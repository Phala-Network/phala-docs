## What Is the Phala Staking Contract?

The Phala Staking Contract lives on **Ethereum Mainnet** and allows users to convert **PHA to vPHA**.  
In simple terms:

- You deposit **PHA** into the staking contract  
- The contract mints and sends you **vPHA** (an ERC-20 token)  
- **vPHA** is used for:
  - Community governance (Snapshot voting)  
  - Staking & collateral on Phala L2  
  - GPU mining (required collateral + reward token)  

In short:  
**PHA = liquid token**,  
**vPHA = governance & staking token** for the Phala ecosystem.

## Official Contract Addresses (Verify Before Use)

Always double-check that you are interacting with the correct contracts:

- **PHA (ERC20)**: `0x6c5bA91642F10282b576d91922Ae6448C9d52f4E`  
- **vPHA (ERC20)**: `0x21d6eC8fc14CaAcc55aFA23cBa66798DAB3a0ec0`

> ⚠️ Only use the addresses above.  
> Do not stake or transfer tokens to any unknown or unverified contract.

## How to Stake PHA and Receive vPHA

> The process works with any EVM wallet such as MetaMask, Rabby, Safe, etc.  
> official Phala staking page: https://app.phala.network/staking .

### **Step 1 — Prepare Your Wallet**

1. Switch wallet to **Ethereum Mainnet**  
2. Make sure your wallet has:
   - **PHA (ERC20)** — the tokens you want to stake  
   - **ETH** — to pay Ethereum gas fees  

### **Step 2 — Connect to the Phala Staking Page**

1. Open the official Phala staking page  
2. Click **“Connect Wallet”**  
3. Approve the connection in your wallet  

### **Step 3 — Stake PHA → Receive vPHA**

1. Enter the amount of **PHA** you want to stake  
2. First-time users must click **Approve** to allow the contract to use PHA  
3. Once approved, click **Stake**  
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet  

After the transaction is confirmed:

- Your PHA is deposited into the staking contract  
- You receive vPHA equal in value to the PHA you staked, based on the real-time vPHA-PHA exchange rate  
- As the staking contract accumulates rewards, the exchange rate increases over time, meaning vPHA represents a growing amount of PHA when you unstake.

To display vPHA, manually add the ERC-20 contract address in your wallet.

## Unstaking vPHA to PHA

Unstaking converts your vPHA back to PHA. The process takes **21 days** to complete.

### Step 1: Initiate Unstaking

1. Go to [app.phala.network/staking](https://app.phala.network/staking)
2. Connect your wallet (must be on **Ethereum Mainnet**)
3. Click **Unstake**
4. Enter the amount of vPHA to unstake
5. Confirm the transaction and pay gas fees

After the transaction confirms, your vPHA enters a 21-day unlock period.

### Step 2: Wait for Unlock Period

- Your tokens are locked for **21 days**
- You can track the unlock countdown in the staking dashboard
- You cannot cancel an unstaking request once initiated

### Step 3: Claim Your PHA

After the 21-day period ends:

1. Return to [app.phala.network/staking](https://app.phala.network/staking)
2. Connect your wallet
3. You'll see your unlocked PHA available to claim
4. Click **Claim** to receive your PHA
5. Confirm the transaction

<Warning>
**You must manually claim your PHA** after the unlock period. Tokens do not automatically transfer to your wallet.
</Warning>

### Unstaking from Phala L2

If your vPHA is on Phala L2 (not Ethereum Mainnet):

1. First, bridge your vPHA to Ethereum using [bridge.phala.network](https://bridge.phala.network)
2. You need ETH on Phala L2 for gas fees (~0.001 ETH is sufficient)
3. Once on Ethereum, follow the unstaking steps above

<Note>
**Need ETH on Phala L2?** Bridge a small amount from Ethereum first using [bridge.phala.network](https://bridge.phala.network).
</Note>

### Troubleshooting

**"Insufficient ETH" error when bridging from L2:**
- You need ETH on Phala L2 for gas, not just on Ethereum
- Bridge ~0.001 ETH from Ethereum to Phala L2 first

**Can't see vPHA in portfolio:**
- Check if your vPHA is on Phala L2 or Ethereum
- Add the vPHA token contract to your wallet: `0x21d6eC8fc14CaAcc55aFA23cBa66798DAB3a0ec0`

**vPHA balance seems lower than expected:**
- vPHA represents staked value at a conversion rate that increases over time
- Check your deposit history at the bottom of the staking page
- If you provided liquidity on Uniswap, your vPHA won't show in the Phala app

## Safety Notes

Always verify:
- Contract addresses before any transaction
- Transaction prompts match your intended action
- You are connected to **Ethereum Mainnet**

<Warning>
Never send tokens to unknown addresses. Only use the official contract addresses listed in this documentation.
</Warning>
