## What Is the Phala Staking Contract?

The Phala Staking Contract lives on **Ethereum Mainnet** and allows users to convert **PHA to vPHA**.  
In simple terms:

- You deposit **PHA** into the staking contract  
- The contract mints and sends you **vPHA** (an ERC-20 token)  
- **vPHA** is used for:
  - Community governance (Snapshot voting)  
  - Staking & collateral on Phala L2  
  - GPU mining (required collateral + reward token)  

In short:  
**PHA = liquid token**,  
**vPHA = governance & staking token** for the Phala ecosystem.

## Official Contract Addresses (Verify Before Use)

Always double-check that you are interacting with the correct contracts:

- **PHA (ERC20)**: `0x6c5bA91642F10282b576d91922Ae6448C9d52f4E`  
- **vPHA (ERC20)**: `0x21d6eC8fc14CaAcc55aFA23cBa66798DAB3a0ec0`

> ⚠️ Only use the addresses above.  
> Do not stake or transfer tokens to any unknown or unverified contract.

## How to Stake PHA and Receive vPHA

> The process works with any EVM wallet such as MetaMask, Rabby, Safe, etc.  
> official Phala staking page: https://app.phala.network/staking .

### **Step 1 — Prepare Your Wallet**

1. Switch wallet to **Ethereum Mainnet**  
2. Make sure your wallet has:
   - **PHA (ERC20)** — the tokens you want to stake  
   - **ETH** — to pay Ethereum gas fees  

### **Step 2 — Connect to the Phala Staking Page**

1. Open the official Phala staking page  
2. Click **“Connect Wallet”**  
3. Approve the connection in your wallet  

### **Step 3 — Stake PHA → Receive vPHA**

1. Enter the amount of **PHA** you want to stake  
2. First-time users must click **Approve** to allow the contract to use PHA  
3. Once approved, click **Stake**  
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet  

After the transaction is confirmed:

- Your PHA is deposited into the staking contract  
- You receive vPHA equal in value to the PHA you staked, based on the real-time vPHA-PHA exchange rate  
- As the staking contract accumulates rewards, the exchange rate increases over time, meaning vPHA represents a growing amount of PHA when you unstake.

To display vPHA, manually add the ERC-20 contract address in your wallet.

## 4. About Unstaking & Safety Notes

- Unstaking vPHA → PHA takes 21 days,  and you need to claim the unlocked PHA manually when the unlocked period finished.  
- Always verify:
  - Contract addresses  
  - Transaction prompts  
  - You are on Ethereum Mainnet  

With these steps, you're successfully participating in Phala’s staking ecosystem.
