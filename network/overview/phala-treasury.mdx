The Treasury is a pot of funds collected through transaction fees, slashing, Secure Worker mining rate (20%) , etc. The funds held in the Treasury can be spent by making a spending proposal that, if approved by the community, will be issued to the receipents. The Treasury attempts to spend as many proposals in the queue as it can without running out of funds.

Proposals may consist of (but are not limited to):

* Infrastructure deployment and continued operation.
* Network security operations (monitoring services, continuous auditing).
* Ecosystem provisions (collaborations with friendly chains).
* Marketing activities (advertising, paid features, collaborations).
* Community events and outreach (meetups, pizza parties, hackerspaces).
* Software development (wallets and wallet integration, clients and client upgrades).

70% of the PHA will be used for Secure Worker Mining, and following the progress of the Phala network, 20% of the mining rewards generated by each block will be used to fund treasury.
