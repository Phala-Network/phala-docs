  processes.
title: Phala Governance
---

Phala uses **Snapshot** as its off-chain governance platform, allowing community members to participate in proposals and voting without paying gas fees. Anyone holding **vPHA** (the governance token) can take part in decision-making.

## How Voting Works

Snapshot takes periodic “snapshots” of wallet balances to determine voting power.  
Your **vPHA balance at the snapshot block** decides how many votes you have.  
No tokens are locked, and no transactions are sent—governance is **gas-free**.

## How to Participate

1. Go to the Phala Snapshot space:  
   **https://snapshot.box/#/s:phala-network.eth**

2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, OKX Wallet, etc.).  
   
3. Browse active proposals:  
   Each proposal includes:
   - Title & description  
   - Voting options  
   - Voting period  
   - Impact on the network  

4. Cast your vote:  
   Choose an option and sign a message.  
   **No gas fee** is involved, as Snapshot uses off-chain signatures.

## Creating a Proposal (for eligible members)

1. Click **New Proposal**  
2. Fill in:
   - Title  
   - Summary and motivation  
   - Voting options (Yes/No/Multiple Choice)  
   - Voting duration  
3. Submit and sign—your proposal will go live instantly.

## Best Practices for Governance

- Hold **vPHA** to participate effectively.  
- Read proposal details carefully before voting.  
- Participate early in case you need to switch networks or adjust your wallet.  
- Discuss proposals on the Discord before they go live.


Phala’s Snapshot governance is designed to be open, gas-free, and accessible.  
If you hold vPHA, no matter it's on Ethereum or Phala L2, you are an active part of the network—your vote directly shapes Phala’s future.
