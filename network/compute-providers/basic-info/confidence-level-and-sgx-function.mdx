title: Confidence Level & SGX Function
---


### Test your Intel¬Æ SGX Capability

The confidence level impacts your worker‚Äôs score. Before configuring your worker, the necessary drivers are required, and the `sgx-test` option determines your Intel¬Æ SGX DCAP Capability.

```bash
sudo docker pull phalanetwork/phala-dcap_test:latest
sudo docker run -it --network host --device /dev/sgx_enclave --device /dev/sgx_provision phalanetwork/phala-dcap_test:latest
```

> This command need to install üê≥ Docker, the required Intel¬Æ SGX drivers, and pull all the necessary Docker images for your Phala worker ü™®‚õèÔ∏è.
>
> * Please follow the instruction during installation.

Information about the checks conducted during execution of the command:

1. SGX system software ‚Üí Able to launch enclaves ‚Üí `Production Mode`
2. Flexible launch control ‚Üí `Able to launch production mode enclave`
3. `isvEnclaveQuoteStatus` and `advisoryIDs` (explained in the next section)

Among them, **the first one is a must to run Phala Network pRuntime**. If it‚Äôs not supported (tagged as ‚úò in the report example below), we are afraid you can‚Äôt contribute computing power with this setup. You may need to replace the motherboard and/or the CPU.

The latter two is not a must, though it is suggested to be checked as it would be essential to install the DCAP driver.

The example below shows a positive result:

If you can not run Phala pRuntime with both of them tagged as ‚úî, you may have to check whether your BIOS is the latest version with latest security patches. If you still can‚Äôt run Phala pRuntime docker with the latest BIOS of your motherboard manufacturer, we are afraid you can‚Äôt contribute computing power for now with this motherboard.

Your confidence level, referred to as the ‚ÄúTier‚Äù in the table below, will appear in the last line of the report after executing `sudo phala sgx-test`.
