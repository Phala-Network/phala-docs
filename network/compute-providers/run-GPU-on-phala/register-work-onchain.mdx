title: Register Your GPU Worker On-Chain and Start Earning Rewards
---

After successfully deploying Dstack, enabling TDX + GPU stack support, your GPU worker is technically online — but **not yet registered on-chain**.  
To actually start earning GPU mining rewards, each GPU must:

1. Pass environment verification  
2. Receive an official **GPU NFT**  
3. Create a **stakepool**  
4. Lock the GPU NFT into the stakepool  
5. Deposit required **vPHA collateral**  
6. Activate mining  

This guide walks you through each step.

## 1. Manual Environment Verification (Required Before On-Chain Registration)

Because the automated GPU verification pipeline is still under development, GPU miners must currently undergo **manual verification**.

After your machine:

- appears online in Phala Cloud  
- shows healthy TDX + GPU stack operation  
- completes all configuration steps  

Please contact the Phala Delegation Team: delegation@phala.network

Include the following:

- Your GPU hardware model (H100 / H200 / B200)  
- Your wallet address (for receiving the NFT)  
- Any logs or additional information if requested  

The Phala team will manually verify:

- TDX environment readiness  
- GPU compatibility and stability  
- Proper Dstack configuration  
- Worker reliability  

Once approved, you may proceed to on-chain registration.

## 2. Receive Your GPU NFT

After the manual verification is completed, the Phala team will help mint a **GPU Worker NFT** for your device.

This NFT:

- Represents your GPU on-chain  
- Stores metadata such as GPU model & reward weight  
- Is mandatory for earning mining rewards  
- Must be locked into your stakepool  

Without the NFT, your GPU **cannot** receive vPHA mining rewards, even if it is online.

## 3. Create Your StakePool

A **stakepool** is a container that:

- Holds your GPU NFTs  
- Stores your required vPHA collateral  
- Tracks your mining activity and earnings  
- Acts as your mining identity on-chain  

Each miner typically only needs **one stakepool**, unless managing GPUs under different ownership structures.

Using your wallet interface (e.g., MetaMask):

1. Click **Create StakePool**  
2. Sign the transaction  
3. Wait for on-chain confirmation  

Your stakepool is now ready.

## 4. Lock Your GPU NFT Into the StakePool

Once your stakepool is created:

1. Open the stakepool interface  
2. Choose **“Lock NFT”**  
3. Select the GPU Worker NFT you just received  
4. Confirm the transaction  

Your GPU is now officially registered on-chain.

## 5. Deposit Required vPHA Collateral

Each GPU requires a certain amount of **vPHA collateral** to ensure network security.

| GPU Model | Required vPHA |
|----------|----------------|
| **H100** | 1250 vPHA      |
| **H100x8** | 10000 vPHA   |
| **H200** | 1875 vPHA      |
| **H200x8** | 15000 vPHA   |
| **B200** | 2250 vPHA      |
| **B200x8** | 18000 vPHA   |

To deposit collateral:

1. Convert PHA → vPHA through the staking contract if needed  
2. Bridge the vPHA to L2 network via "bridge.phala.network"
2. Open your stakepool  
3. Choose **Deposit Collateral**  
4. Deposit the required amount (based on GPU type)  

This collateral:

- Does **not** earn rewards  
- Is used purely as a **security guarantee**  
- Is fully withdrawable when you retire your GPU and exit properly  

## 6. Start Mining and Earn vPHA Rewards

After completing:

- NFT lock  
- vPHA collateral deposit  
- Worker online status in Phala Cloud  

Your GPU will automatically start the mining process.

### Reward Distribution Details

- Rewards are paid in **vPHA**  
- Rewards are calculated hourly and **Payout happens every hour** at the **end of each hour**  

### Reward Weights by GPU Type

| GPU Model | Weight |
|-----------|---------|
| H100      | 1.0     |
| H200      | 1.5     |
| B200      | 1.8     |
