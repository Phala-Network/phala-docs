title: Switch Workers from Solo to PRB Mode
---


Solo workers need to run node, pherry, and pRuntime simultaneously. If you want to switch your worker to PRB mode, you need to perform three steps:

1. Set up at least one PRB Server, details: [PRB deployment](https://docs.phala.network/compute-providers/run-workers-on-phala/prbv3-deployment)
2. Disable the Node and pherry in the Solo miner, leaving only pRuntime running
3. Add the Worker to the PRB UI, details: [Using PRBv3](https://docs.phala.network/compute-providers/run-workers-on-phala/using-prbv3-ui)

If you are using the docker compose content under this Wiki: [Solo worker deployment](https://docs.phala.network/compute-providers/run-workers-on-phala/solo-worker-deployment)

The command to disable Node and pherry is as follows:

```bash
sudo docker container rm -f node
sudo docker container rm -f phala-pherry
```

> If you have customized the docker compose content, please use `sudo docker container ps` to query the running service names and replace `node` and `phala-pherry` in the above commands.
