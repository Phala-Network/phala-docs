description: Cross-chain bridge for transferring assets between Phala and other blockchains.
title: Supported Assets
---


An asset id of type _uint32_ is allocated for each registered asset. Each asset except PHA on Phala will have an unique asset id. You can use [pallet-assets](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/assets) to transfer asset to any accounts within Phala Network.

* Assets on the Phala network

Foreign assets are managed by pallet-assets, supported assets can be found at [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fphala.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/assets). On the Phala network, only PHA can be transferred between parachain and Ethereum.
