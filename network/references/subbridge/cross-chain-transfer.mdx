    > Note: A transfer fee of 0.0512 PHA will be charged for transferring from Khala to Karura. The bridge itself is completely free. This fee is used to pay the XCM fee of the Karura chain. It does not include the transaction fee of the Khala chain.

If it is not received within 1 minute, you can go to the Khala chain explorer ([Subscan](https://khala.subscan.io/)) to check whether you have sent a transaction; if you have any questions, you can consult our [Discord](https://discord.gg/phala-network).
