title: Cluster of Workers

## Cluster: Abstraction of Workers <a href="#cluster-abstraction-of-workers" id="cluster-abstraction-of-workers"></a>

Phala has many Workers but we do not expose them to developers directly. They are organized into _Clusters_ and used by our developers.

* Contracts must be deployed to a Cluster, and a Cluster can hold multiple contracts
  * Contracts in different Clusters have no relationship, even if they share the same code
  * Contracts in one Cluster can call each other, and contracts in different Clusters need to call each other in an XCM-like way (BTW, the XCM support is WIP, so this should be supported soon)
* A Cluster is backed by one or more Workers
  * The Worker will run all the contracts in this Cluster
* Different access controls can be defined for different Clusters
  * like who can deploy how many contracts in this Cluster

Accordingly, we have a two-level contract tokenomics for this design.

* The L1 tokenomics define how you stake $PHA to rent Workers and form your Cluster
  * We will provide the public good Clusters, and people can stake $PHA to get the proportional computing power in our network
* The L2 tokenomics define how Cluster owners charge the contract deployers
  * We provide a [template implementation](https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-blockchain/tree/master/crates/pink-drivers) (with `Public` and `OnlyOwner` rules) and will allow owners to implement their own logic with Phat Contract
