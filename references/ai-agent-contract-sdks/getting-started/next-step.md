# Next Step

Now you have experienced the deployment of your first Phat Contract and invoked it on the serverless Phala computing cloud.

Your next step can be:

* Begin with [stateless applications](broken-reference) and learn how to use Phat Contract’s unique capabilities like
  * send HTTP requests;
  * handle users' requests with no gas fee and low latency;
* Learn where to [store your contract states](broken-reference) including
  * store contract states on-chain;
  * store your data in decentralized storage;
  * use local memory to cache the data;
* Learn about the [infrastructure](../../../developers/getting-started/broken-reference/) to know where your contract is deployed and how your privacy is protected.
