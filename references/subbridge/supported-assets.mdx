# Supported Assets

An asset id of type _uint32_ is allocated for each registered asset. Each asset except PHA on Khala/Phala will have an unique asset id. You can use [pallet-assets](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/assets) to transfer asset to any accounts within Khala and Phala Network.
