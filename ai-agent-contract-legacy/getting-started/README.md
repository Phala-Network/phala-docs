## AI Agent Contract Overview

The AI Agent Contract is a general-purpose program written in TypeScript/JavaScript that is executed in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) on Phala's blockchain. Let's breakdown the process from a developers perspective.

* A developer builds their Agent Contract and publishes their code to IPFS.
* The Agent Contract is served through a gateway where users can make HTTP requests to the deployed agent.
* Phala's Agent Gateway will pull the script from IPFS by fetching the CID and executing the request in a TEE node on Phala's blockchain.

A visualization of the architecture is displayed below:
