# ⛓️ Supported Chains

**WARNING**

This section is no longer recommended for deploying on Phala. To build and deploy securely and efficiently, please use the fully managed [Phala Cloud](https://cloud.phala.network) platform instead. Check out the doc on how to [get started](../cloud/getting-started/getting-started.md).

AI Agent Contract can technically connect to any blockchain for reading and writing operations, as it can effortlessly read from arbitrary blockchain nodes and trigger signed transactions via RPC calls. However, in practice, supporting a specific blockchain requires the corresponding AI Agent Contract RPC client, serialization library, and signing library to facilitate read and write operations. Presently, EVM and Substrate blockchains have more extensive library support.

## EVM Blockchains

At the Native AI Agent Contract level, it is possible to interact with any EVM-compatible blockchains through their RPC nodes, including:

* Ethereum
* Polygon
* Arbitrum
* BSC
* Optimism
* Base
* any other EVM-compatible blockchains

Learn more in the advanced topic section.

## Substrate Blockchains

Native AI Agent Contract fully supports Substrate-based blockchains, including:

* Polkadot
* Kusama
* Phala Network
* Astar
* any other Substrate-based blockchains

You can learn more about AI Agent Contract's cross-chain capabilities and how to implement them in the advanced topics section:

[cross-chain-solutions.md](../references/advanced-topics/cross-chain-solutions.md "mention")

## Expanding Support to Additional Blockchains

Supporting additional blockchains does not necessitate any changes to Phala Network's infrastructure. Developers can independently implement their RPC client, serialization, and signing libraries in Native AI Agent Contract and share them with the community.

The following blockchains are expected to receive support soon:

* Cosmos-based blockchains
* Solana
* Move-based blockchains

Let us know which blockchain you would like to see supported in the `#ai-agent-contract` channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/phala-network).
