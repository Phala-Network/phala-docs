# ðŸ“• Deployment Cheat Sheet

1. **Build docker image on x86 linux**
    
    Since some developers use Mac ARM, we highly recommend using an x86 machine to build your Docker images before deploying them to our cloud to avoid compatibility issues.

2. **Limit the size of your docker logs to save disk usage**
    
    You can config **logging** options for all of your services to limit the size of the docker logs.
    
    ```yaml
    x-common: &common-config
      restart: always
      logging:
        driver: "json-file"
        options:
          max-size: "100m"
          max-file: "5"
    
    services:
      example:
        <<: *common-config
        image: example:0.1.0
        container_name: example
        ports:
          - "8000:8000"
    ```
