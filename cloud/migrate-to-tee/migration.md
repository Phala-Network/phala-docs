# ðŸ”„ Migration to TEE

This section will not cover how to containerize your application with Docker. Instead, we assume you have already done so and have tested it locally to ensure all functionalities work well. Our focus here is to demonstrate how to migrate your application into a TEE, ensuring it remains accessible and providing TEE Proof so you can verify its integrity to anyone interested.
