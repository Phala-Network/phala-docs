# Generate RA Report Inside the Container

The cloud will generate a default RA report for your application when it is bootstrapped. You can view this report on the dashboard under the **Attestation** tab and verify it by clicking the **Check** **Attestation** button.

To generate a new RA report, rather than using the default one, which allows you to prove the execution of your code, you first need to mount the Dstack API socket file to the container by configuring **volumes** in the Docker Compose file.

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: quay.io/jupyter/base-notebook
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
```

In your application, you can generate the RA report using the [Dstack SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phala/dstack-sdk?activeTab=readme), which supports Python, JS, and Go. The `user-data` argument allows you to attach your own data to the RA report. In practice, this is a method to bind the RA report to your application. For example, you can generate a key pair and include the public key. This way, others can verify that the RA report was indeed generated by your program by checking the signature with the public key, after the RA quote itself has been verified.

```javascript
import { TappdClient } from '@phala/dstack-sdk';

const client = new TappdClient();

// Show the information of the Base Image.
await client.info();

// Get a TDX quote for the given custom data and hash algorithm.
const quoteResult = await client.tdxQuote('user-data', 'sha256');
console.log(quoteResult.quote); // TDX quote in hex format
console.log(quoteResult.event_log); // Event log
const rtmrs = quoteResult.replayRtmrs(); // Replay RTMRs
```
