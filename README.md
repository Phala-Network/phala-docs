# What is Phala Network?

## Our Mission <a href="#phala-network-web3-computing-cloud" id="phala-network-web3-computing-cloud"></a>

Phala Network is revolutionizing the world of Web3 development by empowering dApp builders with decentralized off-chain compute infrastructure. By connecting Smart Contracts to off-chain programs, developers can supercharge their dApps with seamless cross-chain integrations, connectivity to the internet, and heavy computation. With [Phat Contract](developers/phat-contract/), the off-chain programming model running on Phala Network, developers have an easy-to-use solution for creating robust and cross-chain capable dApps. Phat Contracts make your Smart Contracts even smarter, and can be integrated in minutes using our no code developer experience.

Web3 developers are constantly pushing up against the technical limitations of building on-chain. Modern dApps need more than just Smart Contracts to support rich feature sets, and as Web3 has evolved and matured, it has become clear that efficient off-chain computation will be vital for a number of standard dApp use cases. Phala gives dApp developers access to powerful off-chain services without sacrificing on decentralization or trustlessness. **This is Computation as it’s Meant to Be.**

Furthermore, in a digital landscape that is becoming increasingly centralized, Phala Network seeks to go against the grain by building a compute network that anybody can provide for or build on-top of, trustlessly. In other words, Phala is a **Public Good Network**.

## Trustless Computation. Verifiable Results.

Phala Network is designed with multiple layers of security guarantees to provide fully verifiable computation. Anybody with the correct hardware can become a compute providing “[Worker](broken-reference)” for the network and earn rewards, and Phala has an array of mechanisms in place to ensure Workers always carry out computation faithfully and securely. [Tokenomic incentives](developers/phat-contract/pay-for-cloud-service.md), hardware-based assurances, and cryptographic evidence of execution published and verified on the Phala blockchain enable Phat Contract to seamlessly extend blockchain-level security to the off-chain realm.

## Supercharge Your dApps with Phat Contract

Developers can use Phala Network by writing and deploying Phat Contracts, programs which run on Phala Network’s Off-Chain Workers that can interface with Smart Contracts on any-chain.

Our no-code experience, Phat Bricks, allows developers to pick and choose from a library of pre-written, audited Phat Contracts to integrate with their Smart Contracts in minutes.

Developers with experience with Rust, ink!, JavaScript, or TypeScript can jump into Native Phat Contract and write their own custom programs to service any number of use-cases.

You can use Phat Contracts to:

* Connect your Smart Contract to any API
* Interface with any S3 storage platform
* Compute over data
* Automate Smart Contracts
* etc.

You can read more about Phat Contract use-cases here.
