Welcome to the official documentation for **Phala** - the secure cloud platform that enables AI developers to deploy applications with hardware-level privacy and verifiable computation.

## What is Phala Cloud

Phala Cloud is a Confidential AI native Neocloud solution that provides you with a secure, user-friendly environment for running AI applications. You can deploy any standard Docker application directly into a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, ensuring your AI models and data remain confidential and tamper-proof.

### Key Features for AI Developers

- **Confidential AI Computing**: Run LLMs and AI models in GPU TEE with hardware-level security
- **Verifiable Results**: Cryptographic proof that your AI computations are genuine and unmodified  
- **Privacy Protection**: Complete confidentiality for your models, data, and algorithms
- **Easy Deployment**: Deploy existing Docker applications with zero code changes
- **Cost Effective**: Web2 pricing model with transparent, second-level billing
