# Confidence Level & SGX Function

### Test your Intel® SGX Capability

The confidence level impacts your worker’s score. Before configuring your worker, the necessary drivers are required, and the `sgx-test` option determines your Intel® SGX Capability alongside the confidence level.

```bash
sudo docker pull phalanetwork/phala-sgx_detect
sudo docker run -it --network host --device /dev/sgx_enclave --device /dev/sgx_provision  --device /dev/sgx_enclave:/dev/sgx/enclave --device /dev/sgx_provision:/dev/sgx/provision  phalanetwork/phala-sgx_detect
```

> This command need to install 🐳 Docker, the required Intel® SGX drivers, and pull all the necessary Docker images for your Phala worker 🪨⛏️.
>
> * Please follow the instruction during installation.

Information about the checks conducted during execution of the command:

1. SGX system software → Able to launch enclaves → `Production Mode`
2. Flexible launch control → `Able to launch production mode enclave`
3. `isvEnclaveQuoteStatus` and `advisoryIDs` (explained in the next section)

Among them, **the first one is a must to run Phala Network pRuntime**. If it’s not supported (tagged as ✘ in the report example below), we are afraid you can’t contribute computing power with this setup. You may need to replace the motherboard and/or the CPU.

The latter two is not a must, though it is suggested to be checked as it would be essential to install the DCAP driver.

The example below shows a positive result:

If you can not run Phala pRuntime with both of them tagged as ✔, you may have to check whether your BIOS is the latest version with latest security patches. If you still can’t run Phala pRuntime docker with the latest BIOS of your motherboard manufacturer, we are afraid you can’t contribute computing power for now with this motherboard.

Your confidence level, referred to as the “Tier” in the table below, will appear in the last line of the report after executing `sudo phala sgx-test`.

### Confidence Level of a Worker

| Level  | isvEnclaveQuoteStatus                                            | advisoryIDs               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Tier 1 | OK                                                               | None                      |
| Tier 2 | SW\_HARDENING\_NEEDED                                            | None                      |
| Tier 3 | CONFIGURATION\_NEEDED, CONFIGURATION\_AND\_SW\_HARDENING\_NEEDED | Whitelisted\*             |
| Tier 4 | CONFIGURATION\_NEEDED, CONFIGURATION\_AND\_SW\_HARDENING\_NEEDED | Some beyond the whitelist |
| Tier 5 | GROUP\_OUT\_OF\_DATE                                             | Any value                 |

The confidence level measures how secure the SGX Enclave execution environment is. It’s determined by the Remote Attestation report from Intel. Among them, `isvEnclaveQuoteStatus` indicates if the platform is vulnerable to some known problems, and `advisoryIDs` indicates the actual affected problems.

Not all the `advisoryIDs` are problematic. Some advisories don’t affect Phala’s security assumption, and therefore are whitelisted:

* INTEL-SA-00219
* INTEL-SA-00334
* INTEL-SA-00381
* INTEL-SA-00389

Tier 1, 2, 3 are considered with the best security level because they are either not affected by any known vulnerability, or the adversary is known trivial. It’s good to run highest valuable apps on these workers, for instance:

* Financial apps: privacy-preserving DEX, DeFi ,etc
* Secret key management: wallet, node KMS, password manager
* Phala Gatekeeper

Tier 4, 5 are considered with reduced security, because these machines require some configuration fix in the BIOS or BIOS firmware (CONFIGURATION\_NEEDED, CONFIGURATION\_AND\_SW\_HARDENING\_NEEDED), or their microcode or the corresponding BIOS firmware are out-of-date (GROUP\_OUT\_OF\_DATE). Therefore we cannot assume the platform is suitable for highest security scenarios. However it’s still good to run batch processing jobs, apps dealing with ephemeral privacy data, and traditional blockchain apps:

* Data analysis jobs (e.g. Web3 Analytics)
* On-chain PvP games
* VPN
* Web2.0 apps
* Blockchain Oracle
* DApps

Once Phala is open for developers to deploy their apps, there will be an option for them to choose which tiers they will accept. Since Tier 1, 2, 3 have better security, they can potentially get higher chance to win the confidential contract assignment. However, Tier 4, 5 are useful in other use cases, and therefore can be a more economic choice for the developers.

If your worker is in tier 4 or 5, please check the FAQ page for potential fixes.
