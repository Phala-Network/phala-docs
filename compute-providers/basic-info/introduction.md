# Introduction

As introduced in the [Gemini Tokenomics](../../introduction/readme/worker-rewards.md), computing power providers can choose to provide their workers on the Phala and Khala networks.

## Phala & Khala network <a href="#phala--khala-network" id="phala--khala-network"></a>

Khala started its staking mechanism earlier than Phala for 16 months. However, both of them currently accept workers deployment and share the same reward distribution mechanism.

We highly recommend computing power providers to first read about [Phala’s tokenomics ](../../introduction/readme/worker-rewards.md)and [staking mechanism](staking-mechanism.md) to understand the calculation of incomings and how the compute supplying proceeds.

Anyone with the appropriate hardware can participate.
