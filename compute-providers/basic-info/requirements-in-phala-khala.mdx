## Basic Requirements

Whether in Phala or Khala, the following requirements for workers are the same.

## SGX Function

Running a worker requires SGX-capable CPU. Please choose a device that supports SGX and enable SGX in the BIOS. For more information, refer to:

## Stable Network

The network of the worker should be as stable as possible with more than 1GB bandwidth. and it's best to have a public IP address.

## OS Requirements

We strongly recommend that you use Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, download [link](https://ubuntu.com/download/server).

> The desktop version of the OS is less stable than Server version, so we strongly recommend using the server version.
