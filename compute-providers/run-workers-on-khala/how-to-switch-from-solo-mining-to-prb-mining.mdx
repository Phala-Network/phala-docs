# How to switch from Solo scripts to PRB worker

## How Solo Worker Works <a href="#how-solo-worker-works" id="how-solo-worker-works"></a>

Solo worker runs 3 Docker containers named Phala-node, Phala-pherry, and Phala-pRuntime.

Node provides blockchain node services; PRuntime provides TEE-runtime services; And Pherry acts as a bridge between TEE and blockchain nodes. The only component that really provides decentralized computing services to the network is pRuntime

## How PRB Works <a href="#how-prb-works" id="how-prb-works"></a>

PRB is “Phala Runtime Bridge” which replaces pherry to make a bridge between the blockchain and pRuntime to convey information in batches.

## How to switch from Solo mining to PRB mining <a href="#how-to-switch-from-solo-mining-to-prb-mining" id="how-to-switch-from-solo-mining-to-prb-mining"></a>

* Turn off Pherry service on solo workers
* Shut down the Node service on solo workers
* Let pRuntime run alone and add pruntime’s endpoint to PRB

## Operation steps <a href="#operation-steps" id="operation-steps"></a>

* Step1 `sudo phala stop`
* Step 2 `sudo mkdir ~/prb`
* Step 3 Copy the docker-compse.yml and .env files in the Solo mining folder to \~/prb
* Step 4 `sudo vim docker-compose.yml` Edit the docker-compose file and delete the descriptions of the node and pherry services
* Step 5 `sudo docker-compose up -d` start pruntime alone
* Step 6 Add the endpoint of this pruntime on the Worker page of Prb (the format is: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8000)
* Step 7 Restart the lifecycle component of prb
