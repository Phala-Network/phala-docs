```

For a status on your block heights, feel free to run:

```
sudo phala status
```

### Download a Snapshot <a href="#download-a-snapshot" id="download-a-snapshot"></a>

> ℹ If your node is close to the newest block height (about several hours to catch up) or already caught up, you don’t need to do anything; sit and wait.

Download the snapshot using the torrent (updated at 4/30/2022): [here](https://wiki.phala.network/files/khala-node-snapshot-2022-04-30.tar.gz.torrent)

The download will take a while, as the file is large. Get some ☕ in the meantime.

> ℹ The snapshot archive is \~750 GB; if you don’t have enough space, consider extracting to an external storage.

To extract the file execute:

```
tar -xvzf khala-node-snapshot-2022-04-30.tar.gz
```

The extraction will take a while to complete as well. After extraction, you should get a folder named `khala-node`. You can list your files with `ls` to verify where you extracted the snapshot.
