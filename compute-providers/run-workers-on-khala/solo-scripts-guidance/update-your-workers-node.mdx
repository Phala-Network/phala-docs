# Update your Worker's Node

To upgrade your worker requires it to stop first.

```
sudo phala stop
```

The worker node can be updated in a clean way which removes all the saved data

```
sudo phala update clean
```

or with the data preserved

```
sudo phala update
```

Finally, restart your worker with:

```
sudo phala start
```
