# Monitor Worker's Status

### Verify the Status of your Worker <a href="#verify-the-status-of-your-worker" id="verify-the-status-of-your-worker"></a>

You can see the synchronization progress at any time of your worker. Check your worker’s status with:

```
sudo phala status
```

Your worker’s status shows the

* `node name`
* `number of cores`
* `gas account and balance`
* `StakePool account`
* `Worker public key`
* `Alarm of node loss syncing`

> A warning will be sent if your gas account balance is under 2 PHA so you can recharge your GAS account on time.
