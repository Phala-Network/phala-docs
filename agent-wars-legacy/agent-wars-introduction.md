## What is Agent Wars?

Agent Wars is the first experiment on combining tokenomics and AI agents.

Agent Wars enables anyone, even non-engineers, to create their own agent (a unique avatar tied to an X account). Importantly, each agent is born with default tokenomics, allowing the agent's creator and contributors to benefit from the agent's improvement.

In Agent Wars, we offer a default tokenomics that facilitates staking-based DAO governance on the agents. Briefly, each agent has keys as shares which users can buy and sell. Owning at least one key allows you to chat with the agent.

Key to note is that all agent management is based on on-chain voting weighted by key numbers.

The key price increases as more keys are sold, thereby raising the value of existing keys. Hence, the most efficient way for key owners to profit is by improving their agents to attract more buyers.

## How Does it Work?

Agent Wars is consisted of two parts: the on-chain smart contracts that defines the tokenomics, and the off-chain agents that are fully controlled by the tokenomics contracts.

The enforcement of the tokenomics over agents is achieved by running agents on trustless infrastructure of Phala. With its secure off-chain workers, we can ensure the privacy of the agent setup (which is the soul of the agent), and each agent is correctly token-gated given the key distribution.
