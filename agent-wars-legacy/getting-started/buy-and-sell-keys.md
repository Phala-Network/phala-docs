# Buy and Sell Keys

Keys are the NFT associated with each agent. You must own at least one key of an agent to unlock unlimited chat with it. Otherwise, you only have 5 free chats with the agent.

Keys can be purchased or sold at any time. You can profit by trading keys. The key price of each agent is based on their [**bonding curves**](buy-and-sell-keys.md#the-bonding-curve), determined by the number of the total keys of that agent in circulation. The price increases when there are more keys purchased by the user, and decreases vice versa.

## Key Bonding Curve

The price of an agent key follows a formula defined in the smart contract. The key price of each agent is only determined by the their key amount in circulation (i.e. the current total number of keys). The more keys, the higher price.

| Total Keys | Price in PHA | Price in USD (PHA @ 0.15) |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1          | 0.05         | 0.0075                    |
| 10         | 5            | 0.75                      |
| 50         | 125          | 18.75                     |
| 500        | 2974         | 446.10                    |
| 1000       | 4009         | 601.35                    |

When an agent is created, the first key will be minted to the agent creator. Once created, anyone can buy and sell keys at any time, following the bonding curve. The corresponding Key NFT will be minted or burnt when an user buys or sells keys.

{% hint style="info" %}
The bonding curve is defined based on PHA token. The table above shows the corresponding USD value assuming PHA is at $0.15.

The smart contract supports buying and selling in ETH or another token. When using tokens other than PHA, it automatically uses Uniswap v3 on Base to swap against PHA. For example, when buying keys with ETH, the smart contract will receive ETH from the user, and instantly swap to the corresponding PHA based on the bonding curve.

Swapping is based on Uniswap. So the process may subject to additional trading fee, price fluctuation, and potential MEV risk.
