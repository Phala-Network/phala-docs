## Contributors

The inspiration for this work stems from [Andrew Miller](https://github.com/amiller)’s pioneering concept of a [Docker-based P2P TEE SDK](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/dstack-speedrunning-a-p2p-confidential-vm/3876).

Special acknowledgment to [Flashbots](https://github.com/flashbots) for building a community around TEE. The TEE Hacker House initiative, organized by [Flashbots](https://github.com/flashbots) and led by [Tina](https://github.com/CarboClanC), has brought together TEE builders to develop tools for TEE-Web3 integration. This collaborative journey has generated invaluable insights for advancing secure, confidential environments within Web3.

Special recognition goes to the Pi-rateship builders who contributed their expertise:

* Teleport: [Sxy Sun](https://github.com/sxysun)
* Flashbots: [Tina](https://github.com/CarboClanC), [Mateusz](https://github.com/Ruteri), [Dmarz](https://github.com/dmarzzz), [Moe](https://github.com/MoeMahhouk)

* Fabric: [@gaoist](https://x.com/gaoist)
* Phala Network: [Kevin Wang](https://github.com/kvinwang), [Shelven Zhou](https://github.com/shelvenzhou)
* And many more...

This project cannot be built without standing on the shoulders of giants:
