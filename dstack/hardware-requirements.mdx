When running Dstack from a hardware perspective, users have three primary options.&#x20;

* **Physical Server:** The first option is to utilize a physical server, also known as a bare metal server, by purchasing and configuring it themselves, which gives complete control over the hardware environment.&#x20;
* **Rent Server from OVH:** Alternatively, users may choose to rent a server from OVH, a reputable hosting provider, and handle the necessary configurations to run Dstack.&#x20;
* **Host on Phala Cloud:** For a more streamlined approach that bypasses configuring the system entirely, getting a Phala Cloud account is a viable option, allowing users to leverage cloud infrastructure, pre-configured for Dstack's operations without the need for initial server setup.

Let's dive into the the options.

### Physical Server

Minimum requirement is to buy an Intel Xeon 5th/6th Generation CPU (TDX Support) and 8 RAM slots filled. The lowest starting cost for a server will be around $3763 USD. Here is a recommended server if you would like to buy your own and set up Dstack.

### Rent Server from OVH

Renting bare metal from OVH has the same requirements as a Physical Server. Typical starting prices for renting a server will run about $854.50/mo. Here is a link to some OVH servers for rent.

### Host on Phala Cloud&#x20;

For those that want to get straight to hosting and testing out Dstack, [sign-up for your Phala Cloud](/cloud/getting-started/sign-up-for-cloud-account) account and head over to the [getting started](/cloud/getting-started/start-from-cloud-ui) section in Phala Cloud to deploy your first CVM in minutes.
