PHA is the native token of the Phala blockchain. It serves several key functions and holders can use the token in a few different ways:

* Workers, the compute providers for Phala Network, receive PHA rewards. Read about how [rewards are calculated](/compute-providers/basic-info/worker-rewards) or [becoming a Worker](/compute-providers/run-workers-on-phala).
* Running programs, or [AI Agent Contracts](#legacy-content-removed), on Phala Network.
* Phala Network is a DAO governed by PHA token holders. Read about Phala's Governance mechanism [here](/overview/pha-token/governance).
* PHA token can be staked or delegated to stakers to support the security of the network and earn rewards. Read about [delegation](/overview/pha-token/delegation) or get started on the [app](https://app.phala.network/).
