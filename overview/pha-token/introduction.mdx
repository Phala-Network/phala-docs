# ðŸª™ Introduction

PHA is the native token of the Phala blockchain. It serves several key functions and holders can use the token in a few different ways:

* Workers, the compute providers for Phala Network, receive PHA rewards. Read about how [rewards are calculated](../../compute-providers/basic-info/worker-rewards.md) or [becoming a Worker](../../compute-providers/run-workers-on-phala/).
* Running programs, or [AI Agent Contracts](../../legacy/ai-agent-contract/), on Phala Network.
* Phala Network is a DAO governed by PHA token holders. Read about Phala's Governance mechanism [here](governance/).
* PHA token can be staked or delegated to stakers to support the security of the network and earn rewards. Read about [delegation](delegation/) or get started on the [app](https://app.phala.network/).
