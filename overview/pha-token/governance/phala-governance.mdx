Phala adopts the same governance mechanism as Polkadot. This is a relatively mature mechanism that governs to ensure the majority of the stake can always command a network. No matter whether the proposal is submitted by the public (PHA token holders) or the council, it will eventually have to go through a referendum where all holders, weighted by stake, make decisions.

To dive deeply into Phala governance, please refer to the Governance section.

## Council <a href="#council" id="council"></a>

To represent passive stakeholders, Phala introduced the idea of a "council". Each council member represents an on-chain account. The council currently consists of 5 members. This is expected to increase over the next few months to 11 members. The council will end up having a fixed number of seats. Click here to learn how to be part of it.
