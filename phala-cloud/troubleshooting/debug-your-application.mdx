When deploying on Phala Cloud, you choose between two CVM base images:

- **`dstack-<version>`** (Production): No remote access. Use this for production deployments.
- **`dstack-dev-<version>`** (Development): Allows SSH access for debugging.

<Note type="danger">
Development images are not recommended for production environments.
</Note>

## SSH Access

The easiest way to debug your CVM is via SSH using the Phala CLI:

```bash
phala ssh my-cvm
```

Once connected, you can inspect containers, check logs, and debug networking:

```bash
docker ps -a
docker logs <container-name>
htop
```

For setup instructions, see [Enable SSH Access](/phala-cloud/networking/enable-ssh-access).
