## Deployment Errors

### No available nodes found

This error indicates no available nodes for deployment.

**Common causes:**
- You've reached your tier's CVM limit
- All nodes are currently at capacity

**Solutions:**
1. Check your [account tier limits](/phala-cloud/pricing#account-tiers-and-limits)
2. Delete unused CVMs to free up capacity
3. Upgrade to a higher tier for more resources
4. Try again later if nodes are temporarily at capacity

### Can't deploy more CVMs - tier limit reached

Each account tier has CVM limits:

| Tier | Max CVMs | Max vCPUs | Max Memory |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Tier 1** | 8 | 16 | 32GB |
| **Tier 2** | 16 | 32 | 64GB |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

**Solutions:**
- Delete unused CVMs
- Contact cloud@phala.network to upgrade your tier

### Deployment blocked - "violates terms & conditions"

Some Docker images trigger anti-spam rules.

**Known triggers:**
- Certain base images that have been abused for spam
- Images with suspicious patterns

**Solutions:**
1. Use official base images (e.g., `python:3.11`, `node:20`)
2. Avoid deprecated or unmaintained base images
3. Contact support if you believe your image was incorrectly flagged

### CVM stuck, can't restart - "process already running"

If your CVM is stuck and won't restart:

**Solution:**
Use the **"Power Off"** button in the Web UI for a force shutdown. This is different from "Stop" and will forcefully terminate the CVM.

1. Go to your CVM in the dashboard
2. Click **Power Off** (not Stop)
3. Wait for the CVM to fully shut down
4. Start the CVM again

If this doesn't work, contact support for assistance.

## Container & Image Errors

### exec format error

```
exec /usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh: exec format error
```

Your Docker image is not compatible with x86_64 architecture. This happens when building on ARM (e.g., Apple Silicon Mac).

**Solution:**
Build your image with the correct platform:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t your-image:tag .
```

Or in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  your-service:
    platform: linux/amd64
    build: .
```

### TEE socket error - "No such file or directory" for dstack.sock

```
Error: /var/run/dstack.sock: No such file or directory
```

**Cause:** Incorrect volume configuration in docker-compose.yml.

**Solution:**
Only mount the socket file, NOT the lock file:

```yaml
# ✅ Correct
volumes:
  - /var/run/dstack.sock:/var/run/dstack.sock

# ❌ Wrong - remove this line
# - /var/run/dstack.sock.lock:/var/run/dstack.sock.lock
```

### [FAILED] Failed to start Virtual Console Setup

You can safely ignore this error. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack/issues/321) in OS image dstack v0.5.4 where the virtual console module was partially removed.

## Networking Issues

### Can't expose non-HTTPS ports

By default, Phala Cloud only exposes **HTTPS/TLS ports** to the public internet.

**For TCP services (SSH, databases, etc.):**
- Use [TCP port forwarding](/phala-cloud/networking/expose-service-to-internet) with TLS wrapping
- See the [TCP services guide](/phala-cloud/networking/expose-service-to-internet#tcp-services)

**For DNS servers:**
Running a DNS server on Phala Cloud is possible but requires workarounds since UDP port 53 cannot be directly exposed. Consider running DNS on a separate server and connecting to your TEE backend.

### SSH connection issues

See the [SSH access guide](/phala-cloud/networking/enable-ssh-access) for detailed troubleshooting.

**Common issues:**
- Not using Development OS image (SSH is disabled on Production OS)
- Missing `DSTACK_ROOT_PASSWORD` or `DSTACK_ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variables
- Using LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL on macOS

## GPU TEE Issues

### "Resource matching failed: No teepod found"

No GPU nodes are currently available matching your requirements.

**Solutions:**
1. Try a different GPU configuration (fewer GPUs)
2. Try again later when resources become available
3. Contact cloud@phala.network for dedicated capacity

**For refunds on failed provisions:**
Email support@phala.network with:
- Payment Order ID
- Order reference

### GPU billing questions

See [GPU TEE Billing](/phala-cloud/pricing#gpu-tee-billing-rules) for details on:
- 24-hour minimum charges
- When billing starts (only on launch)
- Commitment pricing options
