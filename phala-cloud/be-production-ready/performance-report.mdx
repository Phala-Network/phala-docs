### I\. Introduction

**TEE Performance Overview (CVM vs Standard VM)**

Phala Cloud's TEE infrastructure delivers enterprise-grade performance with strong security guarantees. The following sections detail our comprehensive benchmarks across key performance dimensions.

- **Compute Performance**  
  Phala's TEE environment demonstrates exceptional computational efficiency:  
  - **CPU**: 1,271 MIPS for per-core compression  
  - **Scaling**: 79.91% efficiency at 32 threads (10% better than bare metal)  
  - **GPU**: 3,341 TFLOPS for INT8 operations (6.9x AWS GPUs)  

- **Storage I/O**  
  Storage performance shows minimal overhead for most real-world scenarios:  
  - **Random Read**: ~40% latency increase in TEE  
  - **Sequential I/O**: Matches bare-metal at 36.2 GB/s  
  - **Caching**: Significantly improves random read performance  

- **Network & Security**  
  The architecture maintains robust performance under demanding conditions:  
  - **Gateway**: 1,244 QPS at 1,000 concurrent connections 
  - **HTTPS**: 702% latency increase vs HTTP (mitigated by optimizations)

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**  
  Our implementation balances security and performance:  
  - **Baseline**: 5.12x slowdown (18.3 kHz vs non-TEE)  
  - **GPU Acceleration**: Reduces overhead to < 1.8x  
  - **Throughput**: 25.1k proofs/second (GPU-accelerated)
