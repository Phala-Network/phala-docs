# Security Audit Report

**Phala Cloud's security has been independently validated by zkSecurity**, a leading blockchain security firm. In May 2025, zkSecurity conducted a comprehensive audit of Dstack, the underlying infrastructure platform that powers Phala Cloud.

<Note>
**üõ°Ô∏è Third-Party Security Certification**  
This independent security audit demonstrates Phala Network's commitment to transparency and provides assurance that your confidential computing workloads run on a thoroughly vetted platform.
</Note>

## Independent Security Validation

Dstack underwent a comprehensive security audit by zkSecurity in May 2025, covering:
- **Low-level cryptographic implementations** (RATLS, attestation protocols)
- **Production image security** and hardening measures  
- **TEE integration** and measurement integrity
- **Attack surface analysis** and privilege escalation vectors

## Security Architecture

### Trust Boundaries

Phala Cloud inherits Dstack's robust trust model:

- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: Intel TDX provides hardware-level isolation
- **Remote Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of code integrity and environment
- **Measurement Integrity**: Runtime verification through RTMR registers
- **Untrusted Host**: Host operators cannot access your application data

### Key Security Features

#### Hardware-Level Protection
- Intel TDX (Trust Domain Extensions) isolation
- Hardware-enforced memory encryption
- Secure boot and attestation processes
- Protected key derivation and storage

#### Cryptographic Guarantees
- Remote Attestation TLS (RATLS) for secure communications
- Hardware-signed attestation reports
- Tamper-evident measurement chains
- Secure key management protocols

## Security Implications for Cloud Users

### What This Means for Your Applications

**‚úÖ Data Confidentiality**
- Your application code and data are protected from host access
- Memory contents are encrypted at the hardware level
- Network communications use attested TLS connections

**‚úÖ Execution Integrity**
- Applications run in measured, verifiable environments
- Any tampering is detectable through attestation
- Secure boot process ensures trusted code execution

**‚úÖ Zero-Trust Architecture**
- No need to trust Phala Network operators
- Cryptographic verification of all security claims
- Independent auditability of security guarantees

### Production Security Best Practices

Based on the Dstack audit findings, follow these practices:

#### Application Configuration
```json
{
  "allowed_envs": ["API_KEY", "DATABASE_URL"],
  "public_logs": false,
  "local_key_provider_enabled": false,
  "docker_compose_file": "services:\n  app:\n    image: myapp@sha256:abc123...",
}
```

**Key Recommendations:**
- Use specific image digests instead of tags like `latest`
- Limit environment variables to only what's necessary
- Disable public logging for sensitive applications
- Use KMS-provided keys rather than local generation

#### Deployment Security
- Validate attestation reports before trusting deployments
- Use secure environment variable encryption
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Monitor for measurement changes

## Audit Highlights

The zkSecurity audit identified and addressed several important areas:

### Resolved Issues
- **OVMF Configuration**: Upgraded to secure mode (VMM outside TCB)
- **Production Hardening**: Removed debug tools and terminal access
- **Image Security**: Enhanced build process security
- **Documentation**: Improved security guidance

### Ongoing Security Measures
- Regular security reviews and updates
- Continuous monitoring of threat landscape
- Community-driven security improvements
- Transparent reporting of security issues

## Verification and Compliance

### How to Verify Security Claims

1. **Review Attestation Reports**
   ```bash
   # Get attestation for your CVM
   curl -X GET "https://your-app.phala.network/.well-known/attestation"
   ```

2. **Validate Measurements**
   - Check RTMR values match expected application state
   - Verify quote signatures against Intel root certificates
   - Confirm TLS certificate binding to attestation

3. **Monitor Security Status**
   - Set up alerts for measurement changes
   - Review security logs regularly
   - Monitor for new security advisories

### Compliance Considerations

The audited Dstack platform supports compliance requirements for:
- Data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Financial services security standards
- Healthcare data privacy (HIPAA)
- Government confidentiality requirements
