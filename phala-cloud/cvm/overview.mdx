## Choose Your Preferred Method

Phala Cloud offers multiple ways to create and deploy your Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM), accommodating different workflows and preferences. Learn about [Confidential Virtual Machine technology](https://phala.com/confidential-vm) and its enterprise applications.

### Option 1: Using the Phala Cloud UI (Recommended for Beginners)

If you prefer a visual interface with guided steps, the Phala Cloud UI provides an intuitive experience for creating your CVM:

* Want quick deployments without command-line knowledge

### Option 2: Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)

For developers who prefer terminal-based workflows or need to automate deployments:

[**Follow the CLI Guide →**](/phala-cloud/phala-cloud-cli/start-from-cloud-cli)

Use the CLI if you:

* Need automated deployments
* Work with CI/CD pipelines
* Prefer terminal-based workflows
* Want scriptable infrastructure
