## Deployment

<Note type="info">
For more details, checkout the [github repository](https://github.com/Dstack-TEE/dstack-examples/blob/main/custom-domain/dstack-ingress/README.md) for the dstack-ingress dstack examples.
</Note>

For this deployment example, we will be an `nginx` application where the `dstack-ingress` container that will forward traffic the `TARGET_ENDPOINT` that points to the `app` service (running the nginx image) with an exposed port `80` . It is important to know that this can change based on how your docker app's compose file is configured.

Now on to the deployment. Go to you Phala Cloud Dashboard and deploy a new CVM. Select **docker-compose.yml** option for deployment then take the past the docker compose file below into the **Advanced** tab of the CVM configuration page.

```yaml
services:
  dstack-ingress:
    image: kvin/dstack-ingress@sha256:2cc3bc50d71faa4d313084237b0f5d1d25963024f2484c7a6414aed075883cdd
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=example.com
      - TARGET_ENDPOINT=http://app:80
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
      - GATEWAY_DOMAIN=_.${DSTACK_GATEWAY_DOMAIN}
      - CERTBOT_EMAIL=${CERTBOT_EMAIL}
      - SET_CAA=true
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
      - cert-data:/etc/letsencrypt
    restart: unless-stopped
  app:
    image: nginx  # Replace with your application image
    restart: unless-stopped
volumes:
  cert-data:  # Persistent volume for certificates
```

Here's an explanation of the configs:

* `DOMAIN`: Your custom domain (i.e. `your-domain.com` ).
* `TARGET_ENDPOINT`: **Where the ingress should forward all incoming traffic** — i.e. the upstream application `service:port`. In this case, we point to the nginx service `app` on port `80`.&#x20;
* Other variables
  * `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`: Your Cloudflare API token
  * `CERTBOT_EMAIL`: Your email address used for Let's Encrypt email notifications
  * `SET_CAA`: Leave it to `true` to enable CAA record setup. Necessary for a secure zt-https setup.
  * `GATEWAY_DOMAIN`: Leave it unchanged. It points to the dstack gateway domain automatically populated by Phala Cloud.

<details>

<summary>Understanding <code>TARGET_ENDPOINT</code></summary>

Why is `TARGET_ENDPOINT`  important?

*   **Tell the proxy where to send traffic**\
    When a request arrives at `https://your-custom-domain.com`, `dstack-ingress` decrypts TLS and then forwards the HTTP payload to exactly the URL in `TARGET_ENDPOINT`.

    ```
    https://your-custom-domain.com  →  dstack-ingress  →  http://app:80
    ```

- **Decouples host networking from container internals**\
  Your app can stay on port 80 (or 3000, or the exposed port of your app), and you never have to re-map host ports. The ingress simply forwards traffic to “app:80” over the Docker internal network.

In the following example, we will show a more complex configuration for an ElizaOS Deployment where the docker app has a Postgresql + pgvector container that serves as a DB for the ElizaOS `eliza` container. The `SERVER_PORT` is expected to be port `3000` in this example where the `dstack-ingress` will forward traffic through the `DOMAIN` environment variable.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: ankane/pgvector:latest
    environment:
        - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
        - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
        - POSTGRES_DB=eliza
        - PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
    volumes:
        - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
        - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"
    healthcheck:
        test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB}"]
        interval: 5s
        timeout: 5s
        retries: 5
    restart: always
    networks:
      - eliza-network

  eliza:
    image: hashwarlock/elizaos:beta0
    command: sh -c "bun run start"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - SERVER_PORT=${SERVER_PORT}
      - POSTGRES_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/eliza
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    restart: always
    networks:
      - eliza-network

  dstack-ingress:
    image: kvin/dstack-ingress@sha256:2cc3bc50d71faa4d313084237b0f5d1d25963024f2484c7a6414aed075883cdd
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=example.com
      - TARGET_ENDPOINT=http://eliza:3000
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
      - GATEWAY_DOMAIN=_.${DSTACK_GATEWAY_DOMAIN}
      - CERTBOT_EMAIL=${CERTBOT_EMAIL}
      - SET_CAA=true
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
      - cert-data:/etc/letsencrypt
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - eliza-network

Click **Deploy** button and your CVM will deploy in a couple minutes with the custom domain. Here is an example of a custom domain deployed to [phala.incipient.ltd.](https://phala.incipient.ltd)

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/image (20).png" />
</Frame>

**Congratulations!** You've successfully deployed your CVM with a custom domain. Your application is now secured with Zero Trust HTTPS, thanks to the seamless integration of Cloudflare DNS and Let's Encrypt. If you are interested in the verification of this process check the [#domain-attestation-and-verification](#domain-attestation-and-verification "mention").

## Troubleshooting

First, make sure you have configured it properly. `dstack-ingress`  is a sidecar in your docker compose file. When adding it, you should make sure:

1. You have configured the necessary environmental variables and encrypted secrets according as described above
2. Declare the `cert-data`  volume in your docker compose file as it's used by `dstack-ingress`
3. `dstack-ingress`  service is connected to the same network as the service specified in  `TARGET_ENDPOINT` . e.g. If you set `networks: [net1]`  for your app, you should also have it in `dstack-ingress` .

After deploying your app, you can find the `dstack-ingress`  container logs. It should print logs like below:

```
2025-07-17T23:12:12.758817184Z Account registered.
2025-07-17T23:12:12.760403962Z Requesting a certificate for custom-test.phala.systems
2025-07-17T23:12:16.184509409Z Waiting 120 seconds for DNS changes to propagate
2025-07-17T23:14:22.000463333Z 
2025-07-17T23:14:22.000488847Z Successfully received certificate.

```

Finally, access the custom domain. You should see nginx access logs in the `dstack-ingress`  container logs like below:

```
2025-07-17T23:16:15.748373090Z 10.0.3.1 - - [17/Jul/2025:23:16:15 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 615 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/137.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" "-"
```

## Knowledge

Now you have the knowledge base on the custom domain deployment with a basic nginx dstack application. The features you have used to enable your custom domain are defined below:

* Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal via Let's Encrypt
* Cloudflare DNS configuration for CNAME, TXT, and CAA records
* Nginx reverse proxy to route traffic to your application
* Certificate evidence generation for verification

<details>

<summary>Read The Full Explanation</summary>

The dstack-ingress system provides a seamless way to set up custom domains for dstack applications with automatic SSL certificate management. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   * When first deployed, the container automatically obtains SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt using DNS validation
   * It configures Cloudflare DNS by creating necessary CNAME, TXT, and optional CAA records
   * Nginx is configured to use the obtained certificates and proxy requests to your application
2. **DNS Configuration**:
   * A CNAME record is created to point your custom domain to the dstack gateway domain
   * A TXT record is added with application identification information to help dstack-gateway to route traffic to your application
   * If enabled, CAA records are set to restrict which Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for your domain
3. **Certificate Management**:
   * Select the **Create Token** button as shown below
   * SSL certificates are automatically obtained during initial setup
   * A scheduled task runs twice daily to check for certificate renewal
   * When certificates are renewed, Nginx is automatically reloaded to use the new certificates
4. **Evidence Generation**:
   * The system generates evidence files for verification purposes
   * These include the ACME account information and certificate data
   * Evidence files are accessible through a dedicated endpoint

</details>

### Domain Attestation and Verification

The dstack-ingress system provides mechanisms to verify and attest that your custom domain endpoint is secure and properly configured. This comprehensive verification approach ensures the integrity and authenticity of your application.

#### Evidence Collection

When certificates are issued or renewed, the system automatically generates a set of cryptographically linked evidence files:

1. **Access Evidence Files**:
   * Evidence files are accessible at `https://your-domain.com/evidences/`
   * Key files include `acme-account.json`, `cert.pem`, `sha256sum.txt`, and `quote.json`
2. **Verification Chain**:
   * `quote.json` contains a TDX quote with the SHA-256 digest of `sha256sum.txt` embedded in the report\_data field
   * `sha256sum.txt` contains cryptographic checksums of both `acme-account.json` and `cert.pem`
   * When the TDX quote is verified, it cryptographically proves the integrity of the entire evidence chain
3. **Certificate Authentication**:
   * `acme-account.json` contains the ACME account credentials used to request certificates
   * When combined with the CAA DNS record, this provides evidence that certificates can only be requested from within this specific TEE application
   * `cert.pem` is the Let's Encrypt certificate currently serving your custom domain

### CAA Record Verification

If you've enabled CAA records (`SET_CAA=true`), you can verify that only authorized Certificate Authorities can issue certificates for your domain:

```bash
dig CAA your-domain.com
```

The output will display CAA records that restrict certificate issuance exclusively to Let's Encrypt with your specific account URI, providing an additional layer of security.

### TLS Certificate Transparency

All Let's Encrypt certificates are logged in public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, enabling independent verification:

**CT Log Verification**:

* Visit [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) and search for your domain
* Confirm that the certificates match those issued by the dstack-ingress system
* This public logging ensures that all certificates are visible and can be monitored for unauthorized issuance
