This guide helps you diagnose and resolve networking problems in Phala Cloud.

## Connection Refused

Your service isn't responding on the expected port.

### Quick Checks

```bash
# 1. SSH into CVM (development OS only)
ssh my-cvm

# 2. Check if container is running
docker ps

# 3. Check container logs for errors
docker logs <container-name> --tail 50

# 4. Test local connectivity
curl http://localhost:8080
```

### Common Causes

**Port not exposed in docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Add this
```

**Service binding to localhost instead of all interfaces:**
```javascript
// Wrong - only localhost can connect
app.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1');

// Right - accepts external connections
app.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0');
```

**Container crashed on startup:**
```bash
# Check exit code and reason
docker ps -a
docker logs <container-name>
```

## Connection Timeout

The connection hangs without immediate response.

### Diagnosis Steps

```bash
# 1. Test if gateway is reachable
curl -I https://<app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network

# 2. Check TLS handshake
openssl s_client -connect <app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network:443

# 3. Inside CVM, check if service is listening
netstat -tulpn | grep 8080
```

### Common Causes

**Service still starting:** Some applications take time to initialize. Check logs for startup progress.

**Wrong URL format:**
```bash
# Correct - always use port 443 externally
https://<app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network

# Wrong - don't add port to URL
https://<app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network:8080
```

## TLS/Certificate Errors

### TLS Handshake Failed

For default mode (TLS termination):
```bash
# Test the connection
curl -v https://<app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network

# Check certificate details
openssl s_client -connect <app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network:443 \
  -servername <app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network
```

For passthrough mode (`s` suffix):
```bash
# Your service must handle TLS
# Inside CVM, verify TLS is configured
curl https://localhost:8080
```

### Certificate Hostname Mismatch

In passthrough mode, you have two options:

**Option 1: Use a custom domain with dstack-ingress**
```bash
# Your certificate CN should match your custom domain
openssl x509 -in server.crt -text -noout | grep CN
# Should show: CN=your-domain.com
```

**Option 2: Configure your service to ignore hostname validation**
```javascript
// For development only - accepts any certificate
const server = https.createServer({
  key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server.crt'),
  // Don't verify hostname
  requestCert: false
});
```

Note: You cannot get a valid certificate for `*.phala.network` domains. Use passthrough mode primarily with custom domains or for protocols that handle certificates differently (like some databases).

## Custom Domain Issues

### DNS Not Resolving

```bash
# Check if DNS records exist
dig CNAME your-domain.com

# Check TXT record for app identification
dig TXT your-domain.com

# View ingress container logs
docker logs <dstack-ingress-container>
```

### Certificate Not Issued

For custom domains using dstack-ingress:
```bash
# Check certificate evidence
curl https://your-domain.com/evidences/

# Files available:
# - acme-account.json
# - cert.pem
# - sha256sum.txt
# - quote.json
```

DNS propagation takes:
- Cloudflare: ~2 minutes
- Linode: ~5 minutes
- Namecheap: ~2 minutes

### CAA Record Blocking Certificate

If you previously used `SET_CAA=true` and then wiped certificates/account, old CAA records may block new certificate issuance:

```bash
# Check existing CAA records
dig CAA your-domain.com

# If you see old accounturi values, they need to be removed
# Example output that would block:
# your-domain.com. 300 IN CAA 128 issue "letsencrypt.org;accounturi=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/123456789"
```

**Solution options:**

1. **Wait for dstack-ingress to update CAA**: If `SET_CAA=true`, it will attempt to replace old CAA records, but DNS propagation may cause initial failures.

2. **Manually remove old CAA records**: Use your DNS provider's control panel to delete CAA records before redeploying.

3. **Disable CAA temporarily**: Set `SET_CAA=false` to avoid CAA checks during certificate issuance.

Note: Namecheap doesn't support CAA records via API, so this issue won't occur with Namecheap as DNS provider.

## gRPC Connection Failed

### HTTP/2 Not Available

```bash
# Must use 'g' suffix for gRPC
grpcurl <app-id>-50051g.dstack-prod5.phala.network:443 list

# Without 'g' suffix, HTTP/2 isn't enabled
grpcurl <app-id>-50051.dstack-prod5.phala.network:443 list  # Will fail
```

### Testing gRPC Service

```bash
# From outside
grpcurl <app-id>-50051g.dstack-prod5.phala.network:443 list

# Inside CVM (without TLS)
grpcurl -plaintext localhost:50051 list
```

## SSH Access Denied

### Development OS Required

SSH only works with development OS images. Production images have SSH disabled.

### Debug with Verbose Mode

Use the Phala CLI with verbose output to diagnose connection issues:

```bash
phala ssh my-cvm -v
```

This shows detailed connection information including gateway resolution and SSH handshake.

### Check SSH Keys

SSH keys from Account Settings are only injected at CVM creation time. If you added keys after deployment, use Code Update to set `DSTACK_ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY`.

### macOS OpenSSL Issue

If using manual SSH configuration, macOS LibreSSL may cause timeouts:

```bash
# Install OpenSSL via Homebrew
brew install openssl

# Use full path in ProxyCommand
/opt/homebrew/bin/openssl s_client -quiet -connect %h:%p
```

For detailed SSH setup, see [Enable SSH Access](/phala-cloud/networking/enable-ssh-access).

## Debugging Commands

### From Outside CVM

```bash
# Test HTTPS endpoint
curl -v https://<app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network

# Check TLS certificate
openssl s_client -connect <app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network:443

# DNS lookup
dig <app-id>-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network
```

### Inside CVM (SSH Required)

```bash
# Container status
docker ps -a

# Container logs
docker logs <container> --tail 100

# Network interfaces
ip addr show

# Port listeners
netstat -tulpn

# Test outbound connectivity
curl -I https://example.com
```

## Common Patterns

### Service Works Locally but Not Externally

1. Check port is exposed in docker-compose.yml
2. Verify service binds to 0.0.0.0, not 127.0.0.1
3. Confirm URL format is correct (no port number in URL)

### Intermittent Connection Failures

Could indicate unhealthy instances if you have multiple replicas. The gateway removes unhealthy instances from rotation after 5 minutes without WireGuard handshake.

### Works with curl but Not Application

Check if your application:
- Supports SNI (Server Name Indication)
- Uses correct TLS version (1.2 or 1.3)
- Handles redirects properly

## Getting Support

When reporting issues, provide:

1. **Application ID** from your deployment
2. **Exact URL** you're trying to access
3. **Error message** (complete output)
4. **Container logs**: `docker logs <container> --tail 100`
5. **Test results** from debugging commands above

For API error codes like `ERR-01-xxx`, see the [Error Codes Reference](/phala-cloud/references/error-codes).

The more specific information you provide, the faster issues can be resolved.
