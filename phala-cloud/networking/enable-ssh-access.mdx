title: Enable SSH Access  
description: Connect to your CVM via SSH for debugging and management
---

<Warning>
SSH access is only available when you deploy with a **dev** OS image. Select "dstack-dev" as the OS type when creating your CVM. Production OS images have SSH disabled for security.
</Warning>

This guide shows you how to SSH into your CVM through the secure gateway tunnel.

## Prerequisites

- SSH client on your local machine
- OpenSSL installed
- CVM deployed with Development OS

## Step 1: Set Root Credentials

When deploying your CVM, set one of these environment variables:

**For password authentication:**
- Add `DSTACK_ROOT_PASSWORD` as a secure environment variable

**For key-based authentication (recommended):**
- Add `DSTACK_ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY` with your SSH public key

If you need to add credentials after deployment, use "Code Update" in the dashboard to modify environment variables.

## Step 2: Configure Your SSH Client

Add this to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
Host my-cvm
    HostName <app-id>-22.<cluster>.phala.network
    User root
    Port 443
    ProxyCommand openssl s_client -quiet -connect %h:%p
```

Replace:
- `<app-id>` with your application ID (find it in the dashboard)
- `<cluster>` with your cluster (e.g., `us`)

## Step 3: Connect

```bash
ssh my-cvm
```

That's it. You're now connected to your CVM through the secure gateway tunnel.

<Note>
**macOS users:** If you encounter connection timeouts, you may have LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL. Install OpenSSL via Homebrew (`brew install openssl`) and update your ProxyCommand to use the full path to the Homebrew OpenSSL binary.
</Note>

## What You Can Do

Once connected, you have full access to debug and manage your CVM:

```bash
# Check containers
docker ps -a
docker logs <container-name>

# Monitor resources
htop
docker stats

# Debug networking
curl http://localhost:8080
netstat -tulpn
wg show
```

## Security Notes

- SSH traffic is tunneled through TLS via the gateway
- Only your code inside the TEE can see the decrypted SSH session
- Use key-based authentication for production debugging
- Remember to switch to Production OS when you're done debugging

## Windows SSH Access

Windows users can connect to CVMs using PowerShell or Windows Terminal with OpenSSL.

### Option 1: Using Windows OpenSSL

1. **Install OpenSSL for Windows:**
   - Download from [slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
   - Or install via Chocolatey: `choco install openssl`

2. **Create SSH config file:**

   Create or edit `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\config`:
   ```
   Host my-cvm
       HostName <app-id>-22.<cluster>.phala.network
       User root
       Port 443
       ProxyCommand "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" s_client -quiet -connect %h:%p
   ```

3. **Connect:**
   ```powershell
   ssh my-cvm
   ```

### Option 2: Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

If you have WSL installed, the Linux instructions work directly:

1. Open WSL terminal
2. Edit `~/.ssh/config` as shown in the main guide
3. Connect with `ssh my-cvm`

### Option 3: Using PuTTY with Plink

1. Install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)
2. Use Plink with OpenSSL tunneling:
   ```powershell
   plink -proxycmd "openssl s_client -quiet -connect <app-id>-22.<cluster>.phala.network:443" root@<app-id>-22.<cluster>.phala.network
   ```

<Note>
**Windows OpenSSL Path:** If you installed OpenSSL to a different location, update the path in the ProxyCommand accordingly.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

**Permission denied?**
- Verify your credentials are set in environment variables
- Use "Code Update" to add them if forgotten during deployment

**Connection timeout?**
- Check your OpenSSL version: `openssl version`
- macOS users: ensure you're using OpenSSL, not LibreSSL
- Windows users: verify OpenSSL is in your PATH or use the full path

**Connection refused?**
- Confirm you deployed with Development OS, not Production OS

**Windows: 'openssl' is not recognized**
- Install OpenSSL and add it to your system PATH
- Or use the full path to openssl.exe in the ProxyCommand
