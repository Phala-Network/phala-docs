description: Automatic HTTPS endpoints for your containers with zero configuration
---

Phala Cloud gives you automatic HTTPS endpoints for your containers. Deploy your service and get a secure public URL - no configuration needed.

## What You Get

Every container you deploy gets:
- Public HTTPS endpoints that just work
- Automatic TLS certificates (no Let's Encrypt setup)
- Full internet access with any protocol
- Built-in load balancing

Your application URL looks like this:
```
https://<app-id>-<port>.dstack-prod5.phala.network
```

Deploy on port 8080? Your URL is `https://appid-8080.dstack-prod5.phala.network`. Deploy on port 3000? It's `https://appid-3000.dstack-prod5.phala.network`. Simple.

## Zero Configuration Required

Just define your service in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
```

Deploy it and you're done. No reverse proxy setup. No certificate management. No firewall rules. It just works.

## Use Your Own Domain

Want `api.mycompany.com` instead of the default URL? Add the dstack-ingress container to your deployment. It handles DNS setup and SSL certificates automatically through your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Linode, or Namecheap).

## Beyond HTTP

Phala Cloud handles more than just web services:

**Databases**: Expose PostgreSQL or MySQL with automatic TLS encryption. Your database connections are secure by default.

**gRPC Services**: Full HTTP/2 support for modern microservices. Just add a 'g' to your URL suffix.

**TCP Services**: Any TCP protocol works - Redis, custom game servers, message queues. All get automatic TLS wrapping.

**SSH Access**: Debug your containers with SSH access (development mode only).
