description: How Phala Cloud handles networking for your confidential applications - secure by default, simple to use
---

Phala Cloud provides secure networking for your applications by default. Every connection is encrypted and every service runs in isolation.

## How It Works

When you deploy an application to Phala Cloud, we automatically set up secure networking for you. Your app runs inside a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) that's completely isolated from other applications.

Here's what happens when someone connects to your app:

First, their request hits our gateway - think of it as a smart load balancer that knows where every application lives. The gateway creates a secure tunnel to your CVM using WireGuard (like a VPN). Your application never sees raw internet traffic.

The result is enterprise-grade security without manual configuration. VPN tunnels, firewall rules, and certificates are handled automatically.

## Your Application's Network

Every application gets a public URL automatically:
```
https://<app-id>-<port>.us.phala.network
```

This URL routes to your application through our secure gateway. If you expose multiple ports, each gets its own endpoint. For example, port 8080 becomes `<app-id>-8080.us.phala.network`.

Want your own domain like `api.mycompany.com`? Add the dstack-ingress container to your deployment. It handles SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt automatically.

## What Makes This Secure?

Traditional cloud networking trusts the network itself. If you're inside the network, you're trusted. That's how breaches spread.

Phala Cloud uses zero-trust networking instead. Even inside our network, nothing is trusted by default. Every connection must prove it's legitimate through cryptographic verification.

Your CVM can even prove it's running in secure hardware. This is called Remote Attestation - it's like showing an ID that can't be faked. Clients can verify they're talking to your real application, not an imposter.

## Common Networking Tasks

**Need to expose a web service?**
Just add ports to your docker-compose.yml. We handle the rest.

**Want to connect a database?**
Expose the database port with TLS passthrough. Your database stays encrypted end-to-end.

**Building a gRPC service?**
We support HTTP/2 natively. Add the 'g' suffix to your port and you're ready.

**Need to restrict outbound traffic?**
CVMs have controlled egress by default. You decide what your app can access.

## The Two Main Components

### dstack-gateway
This is our main gateway that handles all incoming traffic. It provides load balancing, automatic TLS, and secure routing to your applications. You don't interact with it directly - it just works in the background.

### dstack-ingress (Optional)
Add this to your deployment when you need custom domains. It integrates with your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Linode, or Namecheap) to set up your domain and manage SSL certificates.
