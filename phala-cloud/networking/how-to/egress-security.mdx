description: How outbound connections from CVMs are secured and protected
---

CVMs have full outbound internet connectivity with privacy protections through TEE isolation.

## Supported Protocols

CVMs support standard internet protocols for outbound connections:
- **TCP** - Web services, APIs, databases
- **UDP** - DNS, real-time protocols  
- **HTTP/HTTPS** - REST APIs, web services
- **TLS/SSL** - Secure connections to any service
- **WebSocket** - Real-time communication
- **gRPC** - Modern RPC protocols
- **SMTP/POP3/IMAP** - Email protocols
- **FTP/SFTP** - File transfers

Essentially any protocol that works over standard internet connections.

## Network Isolation

CVMs are isolated from the host system:
- **Host loopback blocked**: Cannot access `127.0.0.1` services on the host
- **Local network restrictions**: Limited access to host's local network
- **Internet access**: Full connectivity to external services

This isolation prevents CVMs from accessing sensitive host infrastructure while maintaining internet connectivity.

## Privacy Through TEE

The combination of secure transport and TEE provides strong privacy:

**Standard TLS encryption** protects data in transit to external services.

**TEE isolation** ensures:
- Memory contents are encrypted and isolated
- No data leakage to the host system or other CVMs
- Code execution is verified and attested

**Result**: Even with network monitoring, the actual application data and behavior remain private and protected.

## Configuration

Network behavior is controlled by the host configuration:
- **User mode networking**: Default with NAT through host IP
- **Firewall rules**: iptables restrictions prevent host access
- **Port restrictions**: Only explicitly mapped ports are accessible externally

## Security Benefits

- **Host protection**: CVMs cannot attack host services
- **Data privacy**: Application traffic and data remain confidential  
- **Attestable connections**: External services can verify TEE authenticity
- **Zero host visibility**: Host cannot inspect application network traffic
