This quickstart shows you how to deploy a web service with public HTTPS access.

## Deploy Your First Service

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
```

Deploy through the [Phala Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.phala.network):
1. Click "Create CVM"
2. Select "docker-compose.yml"
3. Paste the file above
4. Click "Deploy"

## Access Your Service

After deployment completes (about 2 minutes), find your endpoint in the dashboard:

```
https://<app-id>-8000.us.phala.network
```

The format is always `<app-id>-<port>.<cluster>.phala.network`. Your app ID is generated automatically.

Click the link to see the nginx welcome page. Your service is now publicly accessible via HTTPS.

## What You've Deployed

Your nginx container is now:
- Running in a Confidential Virtual Machine (Intel TDX)
- Accessible via HTTPS with automatic TLS certificates
- Connected through secure WireGuard tunneling
