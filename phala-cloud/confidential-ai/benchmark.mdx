## Key Results

**TEE mode on H100/H200 GPUs runs up to 99% efficiency, nearly matching native performance.** This means you get confidential computing with minimal performance penalty.

The efficiency improves as your workload grows. Larger models and longer sequences see even better performance relative to native execution.

## What We Tested

We benchmarked LLM inference in GPU TEE mode using NVIDIA H100 and H200 GPUs. TEE mode encrypts your data and computation while it runs on the GPU.

## Performance Insights

- **Larger models perform better in TEE mode.** Models like Phi3-14B-128k and Llama3.1-70B show higher efficiency because they spend more time computing and less time on I/O operations.
- **Longer sequences boost efficiency.** When you process more tokens (input + output), the computation-to-I/O ratio improves. This makes TEE overhead less noticeable.
- **The sweet spot: High-computation workloads.** TEE mode shines when your GPU is doing heavy lifting. The encryption/decryption overhead becomes trivial compared to the actual computation time.
