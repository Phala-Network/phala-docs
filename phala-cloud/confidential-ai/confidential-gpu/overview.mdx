<Note>
Confidential GPU lets you run AI workloads with hardware-level security. Your models and data stay protected even from cloud providers.

## Why Confidential GPU?

When you train or deploy AI models in the cloud, your data and model weights are typically visible to the cloud provider. Confidential GPU changes this by using TEE-protected hardware that keeps your workloads isolated and encrypted.
