title: Model Template
---

## Why use model templates?

If your preferred model isn't available in the Confidential AI API, you can deploy and manage custom AI models using our model template on GPU TEE. Ideal for [private model training](https://phala.com/solutions/confidential-training) on proprietary datasets and [custom fine-tuned models](https://phala.com/solutions/fine-tuned-models) deployment.

## Deploy your model

Navigate to the **Confidential AI Models** tab in your Phala Cloud dashboard. You'll see available model templates ready for deployment.

<Note>
Don't see your preferred model? We can add custom models—just reach out through [Support](/phala-cloud/support).

Pick your model and hit **Deploy** to get started.

## Configure your deployment

You'll need to fill in a few details to customize your setup:

1. **Service Name**: Give your deployment a memorable name (e.g., "qwen3-8b-d7a7s")
2. **Model Template**: Select your preferred model (e.g., "qwen3")
3. **Node & Image**: Keep the default settings unless you have specific requirements
4. **Resource Plan**: Choose the instance type that matches your workload needs
5. **Scheduled Destroy**: Set an auto-destruction date if needed, or leave empty for manual control
6. **Review**: Check your configuration in the deployment summary
