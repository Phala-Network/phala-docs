description: Deploy dedicated GPU resources for AI models with hourly pricing. Same models as the API but with dedicated performance.
title: Dedicated Models
---

Dedicated Models let you host large language models on dedicated GPU hardware inside trusted execution environments (TEEs). You get the same pre-deployed models as the [Confidential AI API](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/confidential-model/confidential-ai-api), but with dedicated resources and hourly pricing instead of per-request billing.

Choose this option when you need predictable performance or cost efficiency for high-volume inference workloads. For custom workloads beyond pre-deployed models, see [GPU TEE](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/confidential-gpu/deploy-and-verify).

## Prerequisites

- Phala Cloud account with sufficient credits
- Basic familiarity with LLM deployment

## Step 1: Deploy your model

### Access the deployment page

Sign in to your Phala Cloud account and select **Confidential AI Models** from the top navigation bar.

</Frame>

### Choose a model

Locate the model you want to deploy (e.g., `qwen-2.5-7b-instruct`) and click **Deploy** to open the deployment wizard. Review the model description to understand its capabilities. For example, Qwen 2.5 models are instruction-tuned language models optimized for chat and task completion.

<Note>
Don't see your preferred model? We can add custom models—reach out through [Support](/phala-cloud/support).
</Note>

### Configure deployment

Fill out the deployment form with these details:

**Service Name**: Give your deployment a memorable name (e.g., `qwen-2-5-7b-instruct`). Use the auto-generated name or create your own.

**Node & Image**: Select your preferred deployment location and image version. Available options depend on current capacity (e.g., `gpu1 us-west-1` with `dstack-nvidia-0.5.0`).

**Resource Plan**: Review the hardware allocation for your chosen model. For example, `qwen-2.5-7b-instruct` typically includes:
- H200 GPU with 141 GB VRAM
- 24 vCPUs
- 256 GB RAM
- 40 GB disk
- $3.20 per hour pricing

**Scheduled Destroy**: Set an auto-destruction date to avoid ongoing charges, or leave empty for manual control.

### Launch the deployment

Review your configuration and click **Deploy** to launch. Provisioning takes a few minutes.

  <img src="/images/confidential-ai/confidential-model/confidential-ai-models-02.png" alt="Deploy LLM Model" />
</Frame>

Monitor the status in the Active Workloads section on the Confidential AI Models page. Your model will progress through these states:
- **Preparing**: Allocating resources
- **Starting**: Launching the model
- **Running**: Ready to use

<Warning>
Billing starts when the model enters Running status. Remember to stop or schedule destruction when you no longer need the instance.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Access Open WebUI

Once your model reaches Running status, you can access it through Open WebUI, a browser-based chat interface.

### Open the interface

When the workload shows **RUNNING** status, a **Connect UI** button appears under the model card. The button initially reads "Initializing..." while the interface loads. Click it when active to open a new tab.

</Frame>

### Create admin account

On your first visit, create an admin account with your name, email, and password. Click **Create Admin Account** to continue.

<Warning>
**Critical**: Choose a strong password and store it securely. Because your model runs in a confidential environment, even we (the cloud provider) cannot access or reset your password. If you forget it, you'll lose access to all chat history permanently.
</Warning>

After account creation, click **Okay, Let's Go!** to access the chat interface.

## Step 3: Use the chat interface

Open WebUI provides a standard chat interface. Type your questions in the prompt box, manage conversation history in the left sidebar, and use the tools menu (+) for advanced features like file uploads. The interface is intuitive and works like other chat applications you may be familiar with.

## Step 4: Access via API

Beyond the WebUI, you can access your dedicated model programmatically through a REST API. This lets you integrate the model into applications and workflows while preserving confidentiality.

### Find your API details

Navigate to the **Overview** page for your running instance. In the **Inference API** section, you'll see:
- **API Base URL**: Your unique domain endpoint
- **Quickstart**: Example commands and integration guide
- **API Docs**: Complete API reference

Click **Quickstart** to open a modal with detailed instructions and example code.

### Generate an API key

To authenticate API requests, you need an API key from Open WebUI.

Open the WebUI and navigate to **Settings** → **Account** → **API keys**. Create a new key and copy it. Use this key as a Bearer token in all API requests.

<Warning>
Protect your API key like a password. Anyone with the key can access your model.
</Warning>

### Make API requests

All API calls use your instance's base URL (e.g., `https://<app-id>.dstack-prod5.phala.network`). Include your API key in the Authorization header.

#### Chat completions

Send chat completion requests to interact with your model:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello! Can you tell me a fun fact about space?"}
    ]
  }' \
  https://<base_url>/v1/chat/completions
```

The endpoint accepts OpenAI-compatible request bodies with a `model` field and `messages` array.

#### Verify TEE attestation

For enhanced security, fetch attestation reports and cryptographic signatures to verify your requests were processed inside a TEE.

**Get attestation report** for a specific model:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key" \
  "https://<base_url>/v1/attestation/report?model=MODEL_NAME"
```

**Get signature** for a chat completion:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key" \
  "https://<base_url>/v1/signature/{chat_completion_id}?model=MODEL_NAME&signing_algo=ecdsa"
```

These endpoints help you confirm the integrity and provenance of your inference results. See [Verify Attestation](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/verify/verify-attestation) and [Verify Signature](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/verify/verify-signature) for detailed verification guides.

<Note>
API requests incur the same hourly compute charges as WebUI usage. Monitor your usage to control costs.
</Note>

## Managing your instance

Return to the Confidential AI Models page anytime to monitor your model:

**Overview button**: Opens a dashboard with resource metrics, logs, and attestation data.

**Connect UI button**: Always launches the Open WebUI for your model.

<Note>
Billing continues while the instance is running. Stop or schedule destruction when you no longer need the model to avoid ongoing charges.
</Note>

## Next steps

You've deployed a dedicated model and accessed it through Open WebUI! Now you can:

## Troubleshooting

### Connect UI button stuck on "Initializing..."

Wait 2-3 minutes after the model reaches Running status. The interface needs time to fully start. Refresh the Confidential AI Models page if the button doesn't activate.

### Cannot access Open WebUI

Verify your model status is **Running** in the Active Workloads section. Check that you're using the correct URL (should end in `dstack-prod5.phala.network`).

### Forgot admin password

We can't reset your admin password because the model is running in a confidential environment that even the cloud provider doesn't have access to. You will lose all the chat history if you forget your password.
