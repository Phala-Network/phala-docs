## Why use model templates?

If your preferred model isn't available in the Confidential AI API, you can deploy and manage custom AI models using our model template on GPU TEE.

## Deploy your model

Navigate to the **Confidential AI Models** tab in your Phala Cloud dashboard. You'll see available model templates ready for deployment.

<Note>
Don't see your preferred model? We can add custom modelsâ€”just reach out through [Support](/phala-cloud/support).
</Note>

Pick your model and hit **Deploy** to get started.

## Configure your deployment

You'll need to fill in a few details to customize your setup:

1. **Service Name**: Give your deployment a memorable name (e.g., "qwen3-8b-d7a7s")
2. **Model Template**: Select your preferred model (e.g., "qwen3")
3. **Node & Image**: Keep the default settings unless you have specific requirements
4. **Resource Plan**: Choose the instance type that matches your workload needs
5. **Scheduled Destroy**: Set an auto-destruction date if needed, or leave empty for manual control
6. **Review**: Check your configuration in the deployment summary
