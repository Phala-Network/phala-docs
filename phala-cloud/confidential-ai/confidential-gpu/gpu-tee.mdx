## Overview

If the [Confidential AI API](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/confidential-model/confidential-ai-api) and [Model Template](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/confidential-gpu/model-template) do not meet your needs, you can use GPU TEE to rent dedicated GPU servers with TEE protection for custom model deployment, inference, or fine-tuning. Perfect for [confidential AI training and fine-tuning](https://phala.com/solutions/confidential-training) workloads on proprietary datasets.

GPU TEE provides you GPU hardware with `H100/H200/B200` series, NVIDIA Driver `570.133.20` and CUDA `12.8` installed. Learn more about [NVIDIA H100 TEE](https://phala.com/gpu-tee/h100), [H200 TEE](https://phala.com/gpu-tee/h200), and [B200 TEE](https://phala.com/gpu-tee/b200) capabilities and specifications.

Go to the [GPU TEE](https://cloud.phala.network/dashboard/gpu-tee) tab in your Phala Cloud dashboard to get started.

## Available hardware specifications

Firstly, choose GPU types from these TEE-enabled GPUs.

Customize your setup with:

- **Cores and RAM**: CPU cores and RAM allocation
- **Storage**: SSD storage for datasets and models
- **Location**: Choose from available data center regions
- **Scaling**: Deploy 1, or up to 8 GPUs per instance

Once you select the GPU type, you can choose the GPU Count, usually between 1 to 8 GPUs, depending on your workload needs.

Next, choose commitment period option from options, usually from 6 months, 3 months, 1 month, or on-demand based on your project duration.
