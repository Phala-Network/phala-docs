## Serial Output Warnings

These warnings appear in serial output but are safe to ignore.

### NVIDIA Fabric Manager Service Failed

```
[FAILED] Failed to start NVIDIA fabric manager service.
```

Safe to ignore for single-GPU instances. The fabric manager service is only needed for multi-GPU NVLink configurations.

### NVRM Assertion Error

```
NVRM: nvAssertFailed: Assertion failed: 0 @ g_kern_gmmu_nvoc.h:2256
```

Safe to ignore. This is a known warning that doesn't affect GPU functionality.
