## Why you need to verify

The verification process of Confidential AI includes:

- **Attestation Verification** ensure that the hardware and software stack are secure and trustworthy. Attestation verification provides assurance that your workloads are protected from tampering and unauthorized access. This verification includes **TEE Hardware Stack** and **TEE Software Stack**.
- **Integrity Verification** ensure the integrity of your AI workloads, every response comes with cryptographic proof that it ran in a secure TEE. This proof is generated by the TEE and ensures the response is secure and trustworthy.

So the verification process includes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="TEE Hardware Stack">
    Verify the physical hardware stack, including CPU and GPU, is genuine and running in a secure TEE.
  </Step>
  <Step title="TEE Software Stack">
    Verify that the software stack, including operating system, source code, network end-to-end encryption, and distributed root-of-trust, is secure and trustworthy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrity Proof">
    Verify the integrity of request and response content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

So the main workflow is as follows:

  subgraph Attestation [Verify Attestation]
    direction TB
    A0[Get Attestation] ==> A1
    A1[Verify TEE Hardware Stack] ==> A2[Verify TEE Software Stack]
  end
  subgraph Signature [Verify Integrity]
    S1[Get Signature] ==> S2[Verify Signature]
  end
  Request[Secure Request] ==> Attestation
  Request ==> Signature
```

The TEE Hardware Stack, TEE Software Stack, and Integrity Proof form a progressive and interlinked trust chain, ensuring the security and integrity of AI workloads in a TEE. TEE Hardware Stack establishes the physical security foundation, TEE Software Stack extends trust to the software layer, and Integrity Proof ensures the trustworthiness of data processing. These steps together guarantee the security and integrity of AI workloads across the entire system.
