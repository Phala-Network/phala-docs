## Why verification matters

Verification ensures your AI workloads run securely in genuine TEE hardware. You get cryptographic proof that:

- **Hardware is authentic** - GPUs and CPUs are from trusted vendors and running in secure TEE mode
- **Software is untampered** - The entire software stack from OS to application code is verified
- **Responses are trustworthy** - Every AI response comes with proof it ran in a secure TEE

The verification process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="TEE Hardware Stack">
    Verify the physical hardware stack, including CPU and GPU, is genuine and running in a secure TEE.
  </Step>
  <Step title="TEE Software Stack">
    Verify that the software stack, including operating system, source code, network end-to-end encryption, and distributed root-of-trust, is secure and trustworthy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrity Proof">
    Verify the integrity of request and response content.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Here's how the verification workflow looks:

    A1[Verify TEE Hardware Stack] ==> A2[Verify TEE Software Stack]
  end
  subgraph Signature [Verify Integrity]
    S1[Get Signature] ==> S2[Verify Signature]
  end
  Request[Secure Request] ==> Attestation
  Request ==> Signature
```

### How the trust chain works

These three verification steps create a complete security chain:

- **TEE Hardware Stack** establishes the physical foundation - genuine hardware from trusted vendors
- **TEE Software Stack** extends trust to the software layer - verified OS and application code
- **Integrity Proof** ensures data authenticity - cryptographic proof that responses came from the TEE

Together, they guarantee your AI workloads run securely across the entire system.
