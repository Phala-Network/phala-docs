## Why verify Integrity Proof?

Integrity proof verification, also signature, proves your AI responses came from verified TEE hardware. This prevents tampering and ensures response authenticity. Every Confidential AI API response includes a cryptographic signature you can verify.

The signature proves two things:

1. **Request integrity**: The `text` field contains hashes of both your request and the AI's response
2. **Hardware authenticity**: The signature comes from the TEE's `signing_address` you verified earlier

When you verify the signature, you confirm:
- The response matches what the TEE generated
- No one tampered with the data in transit
- The response came from genuine TEE hardware

Here we provide a [Full Signature Verification Example](https://github.com/Phala-Network/confidential-ai-verifier/blob/631cb5bdf2a4bc13d19fffaba7637d44dcbcc03d/examples/signature_verifier.py#L313) to help you understand how to verify the signature of the response from [Confidential AI API](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/confidential-model/confidential-ai-api).

Here we explain the key processes of verifying.

## Get the signature

When you finish the request, parse `chat_id` from the response and then get the signature:

```python Python
...
# Parse `chat_id` from the response result
chat_id = result["chat_id"]
response_hash = result["response_hash"]
...
# Retrieve the signature
sig_response = requests.get(
    f"{BASE_URL}/v1/signature/{chat_id}?model={MODEL}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
)
```

The key fields in the signature response are:

- `text`: It contains the request body hash and response body hash separated by `:`.
- `signature`: The cryptographic signature of the `text` signed by the `signing_address` account in TEE.
- `signing_address`: The public key of the account generated in TEE that signed the signature.
- `signing_algo`: The signature algorithm used.

## Verify signature

The verification process involves the following steps:

```python Python
message = encode_defunct(text=text)
recovered_address = Account.recover_message(message, signature=signature)
return recovered_address.lower() == signing_address.lower()
# True means the signature is valid
```

Once you run the verification code, if it returns `True`, it means the signature is valid. This confirms that the response is authentic and untampered.

## Verify using Etherscan (optional)

If you prefer a visual tool, you can also verify signatures on [Etherscan Tool](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures):

1. Enter the `signing_address` from your attestation report
2. Paste the `text` field from the signature response  
3. Enter the `signature` value
4. Click verify to see the confirmation

This gives you a visual confirmation that everything matches correctly.
