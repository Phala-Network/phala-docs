## Why integrity proof matters

Every Confidential AI response includes a cryptographic signature that proves:

- **Response authenticity** - The AI output came from verified TEE hardware
- **Data integrity** - No one tampered with your request or the AI's response
- **Hardware trust** - The signature comes from the TEE's verified `signing_address`

Verifying the signature confirms:
- The response matches what the TEE generated
- Data wasn't modified during transmission
- The response came from genuine TEE hardware

Use this [full signature verification example](https://github.com/Phala-Network/confidential-ai-verifier/blob/f606cf8675b6d920cdec49f46c5624cbcd7f2f16/examples/signature_verifier.py#L221) to verify responses from the [Confidential AI API](/phala-cloud/confidential-ai/confidential-model/confidential-ai-api).

Here's how the verification process works:

## Get the signature

After making a request, parse the `chat_id` from the response and [fetch the signature](https://github.com/Phala-Network/confidential-ai-verifier/blob/f606cf8675b6d920cdec49f46c5624cbcd7f2f16/examples/signature_verifier.py#L103-L106).

The signature response contains:

- `text` - Hashes of your request and the AI's response, separated by `:`
- `signature` - Cryptographic signature of the `text` field
- `signing_address` - Public key from the TEE that signed the signature
- `signing_algo` - Signature algorithm used

## Verify signature

[Verify the signature](https://github.com/Phala-Network/confidential-ai-verifier/blob/f606cf8675b6d920cdec49f46c5624cbcd7f2f16/examples/signature_verifier.py#L81-L89) to confirm it was signed by the TEE's `signing_address`. A valid signature proves:

- The response came from the verified TEE
- No one tampered with the data
- The AI output is authentic

## Verify using Etherscan (optional)

For visual verification, use the [Etherscan signature tool](https://etherscan.io/verifiedSignatures):

1. Enter the `signing_address` from your attestation report
2. Paste the `text` field from the signature response
3. Enter the `signature` value
4. Click verify to confirm the signature

This provides visual confirmation that all components match correctly.
