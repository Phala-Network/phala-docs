## Images and Vision in Confidential AI

Confidential AI supports various images and vision models, enabling you to leverage the power of visual data in a secure and confidential manner.

## Analyze images

You can use vision models to analyze images, including image recognition, object detection, and image classification.

Replace `<API_KEY>` with your actual API key in the examples below.

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.redpill.ai/v1",
    api_key="<API_KEY>",
)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="phala/gemma-3-27b-it",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" },
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Giant_Pandas_having_a_snack.jpg/2560px-Giant_Pandas_having_a_snack.jpg"
                }
            }
        ]
    }],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

Here's what I see in the image:

*   **Giant Pandas:** There are four young giant pandas in the image. They are black and white and appear to be playful.
*   **Bamboo:** The scene is full of lush, green bamboo. The pandas are among the bamboo and seemingly eating it.
*   **Greenery:** Besides the bamboo, there is other green vegetation surrounding the pandas.
*   **Dirt mound:** The pandas are partially sitting on a raised earth mound.
*   **Outdoor Setting:** It appears to be a natural or zoo-like outdoor enclosure.

The overall impression is of a cute and peaceful scene with baby pandas enjoying their habitat.
