<Note type="warning">
Cloud API is in beta stage and not stabilized yet. Please use it at your own risk. Feel free to join our Telegram group to discuss the usage.
</Note>

You can use the API to access all the features available on the Phala Cloud platform. It shares the same API as the cloud dashboard frontend.

You may want to check our Cloud API example that shows the basic operations like creating and manage a CVM here: [https://github.com/Leechael/phala-cloud-api-example](https://github.com/Leechael/phala-cloud-api-example)

## Error Handling

API errors return structured error codes in the format `ERR-{MODULE}-{CODE}`. See the [Error Codes Reference](/phala-cloud/references/error-codes) for a complete list of error codes and their meanings.
