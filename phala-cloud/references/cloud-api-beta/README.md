# Cloud API (beta)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Cloud API is in beta stage and not stabilized yet. Please use it at your own risk. Feel free to join our Telegram group to discuss the usage.
{% endhint %}

You can use the API to access all the features available on the Phala Cloud platform. It shares the same API as the cloud dashboard frontend.
