The [Dstack SDK](https://github.com/dstack-TEE/dstack) is designed to simplify the process for developers to deploy programs to CVM (Confidential VM) while adhering to security best practices by default. Phala Cloud is a platform built on top of the Dstack SDK, providing developers with a seamless experience for deploying and managing their TEE applications.
