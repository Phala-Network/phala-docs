## Why Attestation Matters

Attestation proves your CVM runs in genuine TEE hardware with the exact software you expect. No one can fake it.

It gives you cryptographic proof covering three layers: Intel TDX hardware, your OS and application code, and the runtime environment. Anyone can independently verify this proof to confirm your CVM's security.

## How Attestation Works

Your CVM generates a cryptographic quote that includes measurements of the Intel TDX CPU, your OS and application images, and optional custom data like public keys or challenge responses.

The quote is signed by Intel hardware. Verifiers check this signature against Intel's root certificates to confirm authenticity.
