## Why Attestation Matters

Attestation (also called Remote Attestation) is a critical security mechanism in TEE environments. It allows a remote verifier to confirm that a CVM is running inside a genuine, secure TEE with the expected configuration and code.

With attestation, you get cryptographic proof that:

- **TEE hardware stack is authentic** - Your CVM runs on genuine Intel hardware with TEE protections enabled
- **TEE software stack is untampered** - The entire software stack from OS to application code is verified
- **Environment is secure** - Your workloads run in a protected TEE environment

## How Attestation Works

Attestation creates a cryptographic proof that binds together:

1. **TEE hardware stack** - Intel TDX CPU measurements and security features
2. **TEE software stack** - OS image, application code, and runtime environment
3. **Custom data** - Optional user-provided data for application-specific verification

This proof can be independently verified by anyone to confirm the security and authenticity of your CVM.
