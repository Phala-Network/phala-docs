## Why Attestation Matters

Attestation proves your CVM runs in genuine TEE hardware with the exact software you expect. No one can fake it.

It gives you cryptographic proof covering three layers: Intel TDX hardware, the operating system, and your application code. Anyone can independently verify this proof to confirm your CVM's security.

You can verify what you control (your application code) or verify everything (including Phala's infrastructure). The choice depends on your security requirements.

## How Attestation Works

Your CVM generates a cryptographic quote that includes measurements of the Intel TDX CPU, OS images, your application configuration, and optional custom data like public keys or challenge responses.

The quote is signed by Intel hardware. Verifiers check this signature against Intel's root certificates to confirm authenticity.

## What You Can Verify

**Your Application**: Prove your specific Docker containers and configuration run unmodified. This verifies no one substituted your code.

**The Platform**: Prove the OS, key management system, and network infrastructure are secure. This verifies Phala's infrastructure integrity.

**Complete Chain**: Verify everything end-to-end with no trust assumptions. This provides complete trustless execution.
