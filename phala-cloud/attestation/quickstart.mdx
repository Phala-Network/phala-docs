description: Get your first attestation proof using the dashboard.
title: Quickstart
---

Get your first attestation proof using just the dashboard. No code required.

## Step 1: Open Attestation Tab

Open your CVM in the [Phala Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.phala.com). Click **View Details** on your CVM card.

Navigate to the **Attestations** tab. You'll see the default attestation quote that was generated during CVM bootstrap.

## Step 2: Check Attestation

Click the **Check Attestation** button in the certificate chain section.

This automatically opens the [TEE Proof Explorer](https://proof.t16z.com/) in a new tab with your quote already loaded and verified.

You'll see verification results showing:
- ✓ Hardware signature is valid (genuine Intel TDX)
- ✓ Quote measurements (MRTD, RTMR0-3)
- ✓ Security status (TCB level, no known vulnerabilities)

## You're Done!

You just verified your CVM runs in genuine TEE hardware. The cryptographic proof shows Intel TDX signed your quote, making it impossible to fake.

You can share the proof URL with anyone who needs to verify your CVM's security.

## What You Verified

**Hardware authenticity**: Intel's signature proves genuine TDX hardware generated this quote.

**Measurement integrity**: The quote includes cryptographic hashes (measurements) of your OS, application, and hardware configuration. Change one byte anywhere, and the measurements won't match.

**Unforgeable proof**: The signature binds all measurements together. No one can modify the quote without invalidating Intel's signature.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand attestation, choose your path:

### Want Programmatic Attestation?

**Generate quotes from code** instead of the dashboard. Useful for APIs, services, or automated verification.

See [Get Attestation](/phala-cloud/attestation/get-attestation) for SDK examples.

### Want to Bind Custom Data?

**Attach challenges, public keys, or nonces** to your quotes. This proves freshness and prevents replay attacks.

See [Get Attestation: Attaching Custom Data](/phala-cloud/attestation/get-attestation#attaching-custom-data-reportdata) for reportData patterns.

### Want to Verify Your Application Code?

**Prove your exact Docker images are running** unmodified. This verifies no one substituted your code.

See [Verify Your Application](/phala-cloud/attestation/verify-your-application) for compose-hash verification.

### Want to Verify Platform Security?

**Verify the OS, KMS, and infrastructure** end-to-end. This proves Phala's platform integrity without trust assumptions.

See [Verify the Platform](/phala-cloud/attestation/verify-the-platform) for complete platform verification.

### Want Complete Security Audit?

**Verify everything with no trust assumptions.** Security researchers and auditors need the complete checklist.

See [Complete Chain of Trust](/phala-cloud/attestation/chain-of-trust) for necessary and sufficient verification.

### Want to Understand Quote Fields?

**Learn what each measurement means** (MRTD, RTMR0-3, reportData, etc.).

See [Attestation Fields Reference](/phala-cloud/attestation/attestation-fields) for field-by-field explanation.
