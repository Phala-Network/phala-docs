title: Verifying Attestation
---

Verification proves your CVM runs in genuine Intel TEE hardware with the exact software you expect. The cryptographic proof covers hardware authenticity, software integrity, and environment security.

## Cloud API Verification (Recommended)

Send your attestation quote to Phala Cloud's API for verification. You'll need either a binary quote file or hex string.

Don't have a quote yet? See [Get Attestation](/phala-cloud/attestation/get-attestation) first.

### Choose your method

**Method 1: Binary File Upload**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://cloud-api.phala.network/api/v1/attestations/verify" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@quote.bin"
```

**Method 2: Hex String**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://cloud-api.phala.network/api/v1/attestations/verify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hex": "0x040002000..."}'
```

### Check the response

Both methods return identical results:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quote": {
    "verified": true,
    "header": { "tee_type": "TEE_TDX" }
  },
  "checksum": "9aa049fb9049d4f582ca316206f7cf34ee185c2b5b63370a518921432385b81a"
}
```

The `checksum` is your quote's unique ID. Use it to share proof or retrieve details:

**Share proof:**

```

**Get details:**
```bash
curl "https://cloud-api.phala.network/api/v1/attestations/view/9aa049fb9049d4f582ca316206f7cf34ee185c2b5b63370a518921432385b81a"
```

### Troubleshooting

- **File not found** → Check your file path
- **Invalid hex** → Remove spaces, use valid hex characters
- **Verification failed** → Development platforms lack Intel certificates

For detailed error handling, see the [API reference](/phala-cloud/phala-cloud-api/attestations).

## Manual Verification (Advanced)

Advanced users can verify quotes locally using Intel DCAP libraries. Extract the TDX quote, verify the signature against Intel's root certificates, check TCB status, and validate measurements.

```python
# Example using Intel DCAP libraries
from sgx_dcap_quote_verify import DCAPQuoteVerifier

verifier = DCAPQuoteVerifier()
result = verifier.verify_quote(quote_data)

if result.is_valid:
    print("Quote verified successfully")
    print(f"TEE Type: {result.tee_type}")
    print(f"TCB Status: {result.tcb_status}")
else:
    print(f"Verification failed: {result.error_message}")
```

## What Gets Verified (And What You Must Check)

API verification proves the quote is cryptographically valid and from genuine Intel hardware. But **this alone doesn't prove the CVM runs your specific code**. You must also compare the measurements against your expected values.

### What the API verifies automatically

**Hardware authenticity:** Intel TDX CPU is genuine, firmware is signed by Intel, no tampering.

**Security status:** No known vulnerabilities (TCB status), quote is fresh, cryptographic signature is valid.

### What YOU must verify manually

After the API confirms the quote is valid, check these measurements match your expectations:

**MRTD (mr_td):** Proves the initial TD configuration. Verify this matches your base image.

**RTMR0-2:** Proves the boot sequence (firmware, kernel, initrd). Verify these match your OS image.

**RTMR3:** Proves your application code. **Critical:** Verify this matches your Docker Compose hash. If RTMR3 doesn't match, someone could be running different code in the TEE.

**reportData:** Verify this contains the expected challenge response or public key you requested.

Without checking these measurements, you only know it's a valid TEE—not that it's running YOUR code.

### How to get reference measurements and verify the full chain of trust

Verifying measurements is just the beginning. For complete security, you must verify the **entire chain of trust** from source code to running CVM.

See **[Chain of Trust](/phala-cloud/attestation/chain-of-trust)** for the complete guide covering:
- How to verify the OS came from audited source code
- How to link Docker images back to your source code
- How to verify encryption keys and governance

**Quick reference for measurements:**
- **MRTD, RTMR0-2:** CVM dashboard shows these for your OS version
- **RTMR3:** Use SDK's `getComposeHash()` + [rtmr3-calculator](https://rtmr3-calculator.vercel.app/)
- **reportData:** Verify it matches what you passed to `getQuote()`

## Verification Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get quote">
    Generate a quote using the dashboard or dstack SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify signature">
    Submit to Phala Cloud's API to verify cryptographic validity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check measurements">
    Compare MRTD, RTMR0-3, and reportData against your expected values. See [Attestation Fields](/phala-cloud/attestation/attestation-fields) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share proof">
    Once measurements match, use the checksum URL to prove your CVM's security.
  </Step>
