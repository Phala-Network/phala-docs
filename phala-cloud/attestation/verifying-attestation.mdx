---

## Why Verify Attestation

Verifying attestation ensures your CVM runs in genuine TEE hardware with authentic software. This gives you cryptographic proof that:

- **TEE hardware stack is authentic** - Intel CPUs have TEE protections enabled
- **TEE software stack is untampered** - The entire software stack from OS to application code is verified
- **Environment is secure** - Your workloads run in a protected TEE environment

## Verification Methods

### Method 1: Cloud API (Recommended)

The easiest way to verify attestation is using Phala Cloud's API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://cloud-api.phala.network/api/v1/attestations/verify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hex": "0x040002000..."}'
```

This returns a verification result and a shareable proof URL:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quote": {
    "verified": true,
    "header": { "tee_type": "TEE_TDX" }
  },
  "checksum": "9aa049fb9049d4f582ca316206f7cf34ee185c2b5b63370a518921432385b81a"
}
```

```

### Method 2: Manual verification

For advanced users who want to verify attestation manually:

1. **Extract Intel TDX quote** from your attestation report
2. **Verify quote signature** using Intel's root certificates
3. **Check TCB status** to ensure no security vulnerabilities
4. **Validate measurements** against expected values

```python
# Example using Intel DCAP libraries
from sgx_dcap_quote_verify import DCAPQuoteVerifier

verifier = DCAPQuoteVerifier()
result = verifier.verify_quote(quote_data)

if result.is_valid:
    print("Quote verified successfully")
    print(f"TEE Type: {result.tee_type}")
    print(f"TCB Status: {result.tcb_status}")
else:
    print(f"Verification failed: {result.error_message}")
```

## What Gets Verified

When you verify attestation, these key components are checked:

### TEE hardware stack verification
- **Intel TDX CPU** - Genuine Intel hardware with TEE enabled
- **Security features** - All TEE protections are active
- **Firmware integrity** - No tampering with system firmware

### TEE software stack verification
- **Operating system** - Verified OS image with known measurements
- **Application code** - Hash of your deployed application
- **Runtime environment** - Secure boot chain and trusted execution

### Security verification
- **No vulnerabilities** - TCB status shows no known security issues
- **Freshness** - Quote was generated recently
- **Authenticity** - Cryptographic proof from Intel's root of trust

## Verification Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Attestation Report">
    Generate or retrieve an attestation quote from your CVM using the dashboard or dstack SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit for Verification">
    Upload your quote to Phala Cloud's verification API or verify manually using Intel tools.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">
    Check the verification status, TCB information, and get a shareable proof URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share Proof">
    Use the verification proof URL to demonstrate your CVM's security to third parties.
  </Step>
