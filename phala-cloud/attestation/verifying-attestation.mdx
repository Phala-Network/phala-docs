## Why Verify Attestation

Verification proves your CVM runs in genuine Intel TEE hardware with the exact software you expect. The cryptographic proof covers hardware authenticity, software integrity, and environment security.

## Verification Methods

### Method 1: Cloud API (Recommended)

Send your quote to Phala Cloud's verification API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://cloud-api.phala.network/api/v1/attestations/verify" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hex": "0x040002000..."}'
```

You get back verification status and a unique checksum:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quote": {
    "verified": true,
    "header": { "tee_type": "TEE_TDX" }
  },
  "checksum": "9aa049fb9049d4f582ca316206f7cf34ee185c2b5b63370a518921432385b81a"
}
```

Share the proof URL with anyone who needs to verify your CVM:

```

### Method 2: Manual verification

Advanced users can verify quotes locally using Intel DCAP libraries. Extract the TDX quote, verify the signature against Intel's root certificates, check TCB status, and validate measurements.

```python
# Example using Intel DCAP libraries
from sgx_dcap_quote_verify import DCAPQuoteVerifier

verifier = DCAPQuoteVerifier()
result = verifier.verify_quote(quote_data)

if result.is_valid:
    print("Quote verified successfully")
    print(f"TEE Type: {result.tee_type}")
    print(f"TCB Status: {result.tcb_status}")
else:
    print(f"Verification failed: {result.error_message}")
```

## What Gets Verified

Verification checks three layers:

**Hardware:** Intel TDX CPU authenticity, security features enabled, firmware integrity.

**Software:** OS image hash, application code hash, secure boot chain.

**Security:** No known vulnerabilities (TCB status), quote freshness, Intel's cryptographic signature.

## Verification Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get quote">
    Generate a quote using the dashboard or dstack SDK.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Submit to Phala Cloud's API or verify locally with Intel tools.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share proof">
    Use the checksum URL to prove your CVM's security to anyone.
  </Step>
