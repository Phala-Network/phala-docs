Or run without installing: `npx phala` / `bunx phala`

## Get Started

Follow the [Deploy Your First CVM](/phala-cloud/phala-cloud-cli/start-from-cloud-cli) tutorial to deploy a Jupyter notebook and test TEE functions in under 10 minutes.

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `phala login` | Authenticate with Phala Cloud |

## Local Development

Test your application locally before deploying:

The simulator provides a local TEE environment for development. See [Local Development](/dstack/local-development) for details.

## CI/CD

Automate deployments with GitHub Actions. See [Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline](/phala-cloud/phala-cloud-cli/ci-cd-automation/setup-a-ci-cd-pipeline).
