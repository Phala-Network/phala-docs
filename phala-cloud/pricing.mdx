# Phala Cloud Pricing

We've made our pricing simple and clear so you can easily plan your costs.

## How Pricing Works

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Only pay for time your CVMs are running
- **Per-minute billing**: Pay for exact minutes used
- **No hidden fees**: We track usage automatically
- **No minimums**: No subscription or minimum usage required

## Compute and Storage

Pricing consists of two separate components:

### Compute

- Billed based on the instance type you select
- **Only charged while your CVM is running**
- When you stop a CVM, compute billing stops immediately

### Storage

- Billed at **$0.000139 per GB per hour** (~$0.10 per GB per month)
- **Charged for both running and stopped CVMs**
- To stop storage charges completely, you must delete the CVM
- Minimum disk size is 20GB per CVM
- System space is not included in disk allocation - you get the full disk size for your data

## Pricing Example

A CVM using `tdx.large` (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) with 100GB disk:

**While running:**
- Compute: $0.232/hour (based on instance type)
- Storage: 100 × $0.000139 = $0.0139/hour
- **Total: ~$0.246/hour**

**While stopped:**
- Compute: $0/hour
- Storage: 100 × $0.000139 = $0.0139/hour
- **Total: ~$0.014/hour**

## Instance Types

We offer pre-configured instance types optimized for different workloads. View available instance types and pricing in the [Phala Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.phala.com/pricing).

## Account Tiers and Limits

| Tier | CVMs | vCPUs | Memory | Total Disk | Per-CVM Disk |
|------|------|-------|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Tier 1** | 8 | 16 | 32GB | 160GB | 80GB |
| **Tier 2** | 16 | 32 | 64GB | 1TB | 256GB |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |

New accounts start at Tier 1. Need more resources? Contact us to upgrade your tier.

## GPU Instances

GPU instances are available for AI and machine learning workloads. Due to limited availability, GPU resources require a reservation.

To request GPU access, please contact us at cloud@phala.network with your use case and requirements.

## What You Don't Pay For

- **Compute for stopped CVMs**: $0 when powered off (storage fees still apply)
- **Setup time**: No charge for image pulling or creation
- **Failed starts**: Not charged if CVM fails to start

## Network and Regions

- **Regions**: Currently available in US, with EU coming soon
- **Pricing**: Same rates across all regions (all prices in USD)
- **Data Transfer**: Each CVM includes bandwidth based on size

## Legacy Free CVM Instance

For legacy accounts with existing free CVM instances:
- **Legacy instances** will be automatically reclaimed 6 months after their creation date
- **Manual deletion** may occur at any time for inactive or non-compliant instances
- **Migration recommended** to paid plans for continued service

## Enterprise Support

For larger workloads:
- **Volume discounts** for sustained usage
- **Annual billing** options
- **Custom support packages**
- **99.9% uptime SLA**
