description: Get started quickly with Next.js and Python templates on Phala Cloud.
title: NextJS & Python
---


There are a couple templates that we offer to allow you to get started without any heavy lifting. The steps to get started are simple and easy to test in a few minutes.

<Note type="warning">
#### Before You Start

Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) started before you begin. \
\
Also, make sure you have gone through the [Sign-up for Cloud Account](/phala-cloud/getting-started/sign-up-for-cloud-account) section before continuing.

### Phala Cloud Next.js Starter

This is a template for developing a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-based app with boilerplate code targeting deployment on [Phala Cloud](https://cloud.phala.network/) and [DStack](https://github.com/dstack-TEE/dstack/). It includes the SDK by default to make integration with TEE features easier. This repo also includes a default Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for deployment.

### Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) >= v18.18
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* Docker or Orbstack

### Development

First, you need to clone this repo:

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-cloud-nextjs-starter.git
```

Next, let's initialize the development environment:

```shell
yarn
cp env.local.example .env.local
```

We also need to download the DStack simulator:

```shell
# Mac
wget https://github.com/Leechael/tappd-simulator/releases/download/v0.1.4/tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin.tgz
tar -xvf tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin.tgz
cd tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin
./tappd-simulator -l unix:/tmp/tappd.sock

# Linux
wget https://github.com/Leechael/tappd-simulator/releases/download/v0.1.4/tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl.tgz
tar -xvf tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl.tgz
cd tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl
./tappd-simulator -l unix:/tmp/tappd.sock
```

Once the simulator is running, you need to open another terminal to start your Next.js development server:

```shell
yarn dev
```

By default, the Next.js development server will listen on port 3000. Open http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in your browser and check.

This repo also includes code snippets for the following common use cases:

* `/api/tdx_quote`: The `reportdata` is `test` and generates the quote for attestation report via `tdxQuote` API.
* `/api/tdx_quote_raw`: The `reportdata` is `Hello DStack!` and generates the quote for attestation report. The difference from `/api/dx_quote` is that you can see the raw text `Hello DStack!` in [Attestation Explorer](https://proof.t16z.com/).
* `/api/eth_account/address`: Using the `deriveKey` API to generate a deterministic wallet for Ethereum, a.k.a. a wallet held by the TEE instance.
* `/api/solana_account/address`: Using the `deriveKey` API to generate a deterministic wallet for Solana, a.k.a. a wallet held by the TEE instance.

</Tab>
</Tabs>
* `/api/info`: Returns the TCB Info of the hosted CVM.

### Build and Publish to Docker Registry

You need to build the image and push it to DockerHub for deployment. The following instructions are for publishing to a public registry via DockerHub:

<Note type="warning">
For this to be logged into Docker to push to registry. Run docker login to login in the CLI.
</Note>

#### Build and Publish with Docker CLI

```shell
docker build . -t <docker-username>/my-app:latest
docker push <docker-username>/my-app:latest
```

#### Build and Publish with Phala Cloud CLI

```sh
npx phala docker build -i my-app -t latest -f ./Dockerfile
npx phala docker push -i <docker-username>/my-app:latest
```

Now we have an official docker image for our nextjs app. Let's deploy to Phala Cloud now.

### Deploy to Phala Cloud

You can copy and paste the `docker-compose.yml` file from this repo to see the example up and running.

#### Deploy in Phala UI

Go to your Phala Cloud dashboard and click Deploy. You will have an option for deploying via docker compose file. Click on this option to deploy.

    <img src="/images/create-cvm-01.png" alt="Screenshot" />
</Frame>

You will come to a CVM configuration page. Click on **Advanced** and replace the default docker compose contents with the following (Make sure to replace the `<docker-username>`with your own:

```docker
services:
  app:
    image: <docker-username>/my-app:latest
    container_name: app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
```

#### Deploy via Phala Cloud CLI

For those using the CLI, you can deploy from the terminal with:

<Note type="warning">
Make sure to change the `image` field to match your published docker image (ex: `0xii/my-app:latest`)
</Note>

```sh
npx phala cvms create -c docker-compose.yml -n my-app
```

#### Interact with Your Next.js App in Phala Cloud

Your application should be deployed now to your Phala Cloud dashboard. Go to the **Network** tab to be able to open your application.

## Phala Cloud Python Starter

This is a template for developing a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)-based app with boilerplate code targeting deployment on [Phala Cloud](https://cloud.phala.network/) and [Dstack](https://github.com/dstack-TEE/dstack). It includes the SDK by default to make integration with TEE features easier. This repo also includes a default Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for deployment.

### Development

In this tutorial, we'll start with venv and pip. First, you need to clone this repo:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Phala-Network/phala-cloud-python-starter.git
```

Next, let's initialize the development environment with venv & pip:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cp env.example .env
```

We also need to download the DStack simulator:

```bash
# Mac
wget https://github.com/Leechael/tappd-simulator/releases/download/v0.1.4/tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin.tgz
tar -xvf tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin.tgz
cd tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin
./tappd-simulator -l unix:/tmp/tappd.sock

# Linux
wget https://github.com/Leechael/tappd-simulator/releases/download/v0.1.4/tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl.tgz
tar -xvf tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl.tgz
cd tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl
./tappd-simulator -l unix:/tmp/tappd.sock
```

Once the simulator is running, you need to open another terminal to start your FastAPI development server:

```bash
# Activate the Python venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the FastAPI dev server
python -m fastapi dev
```

By default, the FastAPI development server will listen on port 8000. Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/tdx\_quote](http://127.0.0.1:8000/tdx_quote) in your browser to get the quote with reportdata `test`.

#### Build and Publish with Docker CLI

```bash
docker build . -t <docker-username>/my-app:latest
docker push <docker-username>/my-app:latest
```

#### Build and Publish with Phala Cloud CLI

```bash
npx phala docker build -i my-app -t latest -f ./Dockerfile
npx phala docker push -i <docker-username>/my-app:latest
```

Now we have an official docker image for our nextjs app. Let's deploy to Phala Cloud now.

### Deploy to Phala Cloud

You can copy and paste the `docker-compose.yml` file from this repo to see the example up and running.

#### Deploy in Phala UI

Go to your Phala Cloud dashboard and click Deploy. You will have an option for deploying via docker compose file. Click on this option to deploy.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/create-cvm-01.png" alt="Screenshot" />

You will come to a CVM configuration page. Click on **Advanced** and replace the default docker compose contents with the following (Make sure to replace the `<docker-username>`with your own:

```
services:
  app:
    image: <docker-username>/my-app:latest
    container_name: app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock
```

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/getting-started/phala-cloud-templates-04.png" alt="Screenshot" />
</Frame>

Now you can interact with your application by going to the **Network** tab and making calls like the following.

<Frame>
    <img src="/images/getting-started/phala-cloud-templates-05.png" alt="Screenshot" />
</Frame>

<Frame caption="/tdx_quote">

</Frame>

<Frame caption="/derive_key">
    <img src="/images/getting-started/phala-cloud-templates-07.png" alt="Screenshot" />
</Frame>

And output of **GET /eth_account**
```json
{
    "address":"0xf75647Ec8372BF710D95ad634EDb1ED198CeAE6C"
}
```

Output of **GET /sol_account**
```json
{
    "address":"5JPbG1BP7pZQWsoqQsyCLSvs56SpC2ZAgSHLouVX5Vdn"
}
```
</Tab>

## Conclusion

The last 2 tutorials were key to understanding the basics of deploying a Docker app on a TEE Server. Now you are ready to start building on Dstack! For more info on the design of Dstack, check out the [Design Documents](/dstack/design-documents/whitepaper).
