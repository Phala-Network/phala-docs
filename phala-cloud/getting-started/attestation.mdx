## Introduction

Remote Attestation (RA) is a critical security mechanism in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel TDX. It allows a remote verifier to confirm that an application is running inside a genuine, secure TEE with the expected configuration and code. This guide explains the key fields in TEE attestation reports, with a specific focus on Intel TDX attestation as used by Phala Cloud.

Let’s get into it!

### How to get Attestation Report

You can get full attestation report at the **CVM Dashboard→Attestation** page.
